Price targets for the stock in 2024 range from $53 at the low end to $380 at the high end.\n\nWith the stock firmly in the middle of those two estimates, there's either massive risk or massive reward for investors buying at today's prices. But who's right?\n\nThe Tesla share price looks set to end the year just above the mid-point between these numbers That gives the entire company a market value in the region of $790bn.\n\nThe low end estimate of $53 implies the entire company is worth around $166bn. That's still quite a lot \u2013 it's about the same as Disney , or slightly more than HSBC\n\nA share price of $380 gives the firm a total value of $1.2trn. For context, that's about the size of Nvidia , or 10 times the size of Unilever\n\nSo which should it be? From an investment perspective, the question comes down to how much cash Tesla is going to generate in the future.\n\nLet's talk numbers\n\nRight now, UK investors can buy a government bond that will pay 3.7% for the next 10 years. So in order for Tesla to be a decent investment, it needs to be able to generate a better return than that.\n\nAt $53 per share, that's a free cash flow of $6.1bn per year on average. A target of $380 means the company needs to generate $44bn per year.\n\nTesla has managed $3.7bn in free cash, so it has some growing to do. To get to $6.1bn on average takes around 10% annual growth and $44bn requires annual growth of just over 50% per year.\n\nNone of this should be controversial. It's also clear Tesla is uniquely positioned at the leading edge of some potentially huge technological advances \u2013 the only question is what these will be worth.\n\nA screaming buy?\n\nThe kind of calculation I've been sketching here is how Warren Buffett thinks about investing. But the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has another important rule when it comes to these questions.\n\nAccording to Buffett, if it isn't obvious that a company will make enough cash to provide a suitable return, the stock isn't one to buy. As Buffett puts it, the fact \u201c ought to just kind of scream at you \u201c.","Entities":["Warren Buffett","Nvidia","Hathaway","Tesla","Buffett","Disney","UK","Unilever"]}

The state's AB 587 requires social companies to publish their content moderation policies, something Musk's X (formerly Twitter) claimed violated the First Amendment. US District Judge William Shubb wrote on Thursday, \u201cIt does not appear that the requirement is unjustified or unduly burdensome within the context of First Amendment law.\u201d\n  X's lawyers had argued the law was unconstitutional and would lead to censorship. AB 587 \u201chas both the purpose and likely effect of pressuring companies such as X Corp. to remove, demonetize, or deprioritize constitutionally-protected speech,\u201d the company wrote in its lawsuit , filed in September. The company claimed the law's \u201ctrue intent\u201d was to \u201cpressure social media platforms to \u2018eliminate' certain constitutionally-protected content viewed by the State as problematic.\u201d\n  Judge Shubb saw things differently. \u201cThe reports required by AB 587 are purely factual,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe reporting requirement merely requires social media companies to identify their existing content moderation policies, if any, related to the specified categories.\u201d\n  He continued, \u201cThe required disclosures are also uncontroversial. The mere fact that the reports may be \u2018tied in some way to a controversial issue' does not make the reports themselves controversial.\u201d\n  Shubb concluded that California's Attorney General Rob Bonta met the burden of demonstrating the law was \u201creasonably related to a substantial government interest in requiring social media companies to be transparent about their content moderation policies and practices so that consumers can make informed decisions about where they consume and disseminate news and information.\u201d\n  It's been a rocky year for X in Musk's first year of ownership. The company changed its name hired a new CEO , launched a snarky AI chatbot , brought back a notorious conspiracy theorist and bled money as the ad industry got cold feet about brands sitting next to content from Nazi sympathizers . Oh, and the EU has opened formal infringement proceedings against the company formerly known as Twitter.","Entities":["Elon Musk's","State","AB 587","AI","Shubb","Rob Bonta","William Shubb","X Corp.","US","EU","Twitter","Musk","California","Verge"]}

In April, the Twitter logo was even temporarily replaced by the Dogecoin logo, sending the price of the cryptocurrency up 20% in half an hour.\n\nTesla, another Musk firm, also has a big stake in crypto. As of the third quarter, the electric vehicle company had just over $184 million worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, although that amount has remained unchanged for several quarters.\n\nX's revenue has fallen in recent months as advertisers have been put off by controversial content and Musk's own public comments.

A high valuation, a recent net income decrease, and founder and CEO Elon Musk's PR difficulties are all risks I must consider. Nonetheless, the company is my top stock this December, and I'm buying more. Here are the top three reasons why.\n\nThe stock is currently down around 40% from its all-time high. It started falling in October 2021. This presents a compelling opportunity for me. I'm always gutted when I miss an investment in a great company when the shares are on sale. This time, I'm not letting Tesla pass me by. However, some immediate risks with the price include a price-to-earnings ratio of around 75, which is very high, even by technology sector standards. And a low price doesn't mean the price won't fall further. That's why, as a Fool, I'm well diversified in my portfolio. That keeps me protected from industry, geography, and company-specific risk.\n\nI'm most excited by Tesla's autonomous driving initiatives driven by artificial intelligence (AI). I believe this is going to help Tesla's margins significantly. This development is important to me because the company saw a drop in net income recently, from $12.6bn in 2022 to $10.8bn for the last trailing 12-month period. With margins being one of the company's most critiqued financial points, I believe that if it successfully implements autonomous taxi initiatives, it will become strong on this front. My strong sentiment for Tesla's future related to this hinges on the fact that the company could technically still be successful if it sold its cars at no initial profit. If it revenue shares autonomous taxi services on a 50\/50 revenue split with Tesla vehicle owners, it would be raking in cash daily for years after a car is sold to market.\n\nTesla's energy storage business develops and distributes advanced battery storage systems. These include the Powerwall for residential use and the Megapack for larger utility projects. Both of these products store and manage renewable energy efficiently.","Entities":["Elon Musk's","AI","Tesla"]}

But is that a realistic expectation for Tesla shareholders?\n\n$380? Really?!\n\nAt first sight, the Morgan Stanley price target seems unlikely. The analyst consensus is for Tesla to achieve $3.07 in earnings per share next year, so $380 implies a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 124.\n\nThat's certainly high, but there are a couple of things worth noting, here. The first is that a P\/E ratio probably isn't a great metric to value Tesla shares with.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a P\/E ratio of 85 after earnings in Q3 come in lower than forecast as a result of price cuts weighing on revenues. Investors mostly seem to have decided they don't care.\n\nWhat matters is two things. The first is the scope of the company's potential and the second is the likelihood of the business achieving that potential.\n\nThat's why the Tesla share price has done so well in 2023 despite a decline in earnings per share. Investors believe that the company's prospects are better than they were 12 months ago.\n\nNot your average car company\n\nMorgan Stanley is fully subscribed to the view that Tesla is much more than a car company. According to the bank, the car business accounts for around $86 of its target.\n\nInterestingly, that doesn't imply that the company has a huge edge when it comes to manufacturing cars. At $86 per share, a market cap of $269bn is implied, which is only slightly higher than Toyota ($244bn).\n\nThe rest comes from other ventures shareholders will be familiar with \u2013 battery technology, licensing, driverless vehicle systems, and so on. Tesla has a clear edge, and the only question is what that's worth.\n\nMorgan Stanley thinks the answer is $927bn, or $296 per share. This is based on an earnings forecast of $17 per share by 2030 \u2013 if that happens, $380 next year won't look like much.","Entities":["Tesla","Morgan Stanley","Toyota"]}

And they did.\n\nIn addition to cutting prices for the Model 3 and Model Y in several European countries, Tesla cut prices for those cars in a big way in the US \u2014 likely in the name of boosting demand and to bring these cars under the price caps for the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax credit ($55K for sedans, $80K for SUVs and trucks).\n\nFor example, Tesla's Model Y Long Range started the year at $65,990; currently the price on Tesla's website is $48,990 \u2014 a cut of nearly 26%. The Model 3 RWD sedan went from $46,990 to $38,990, a drop of 17%. Ford in the US and other EV makers cut prices in response to Tesla's deep price cuts.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said the the cuts are the \u201cright medicine at the right time.\u201d But margins were the victim in Tesla's move to gain more ground and increase volume in the EV battleground.\n\n\u201cTesla took prices down earlier in the year. They didn't really get much out of it; I would say it stopped the bleeding,\u201d Gary Black, Future Fund managing partner, told Yahoo Finance.

Reuters reported that in a San Francisco hearing on Thursday, a federal judge shot down Musk's attorney's challenge on whether the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) officials had the power to issue subpoenas, thus ruling that the exec must therefore comply with the regulator and appear for testimony. US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler was quoted saying, \"you've got one more four-hour deposition, one more day of depositions to survive and it's over.\" Failing that, the judge would have to issue an order.\n\nThe SEC's ongoing probe dives into Musk's late disclosure of his stake in Twitter \u2014 a publicly-traded company back then \u2014 which went against the requirements of US securities law. This 10-day delay on the paperwork, along with some potentially misleading information within, may have earned the exec as much as $156 million, according to The Washington Post. Former Twitter shareholders also filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk over his controversial $44 billion takeover of the social media platform, which has since been renamed X.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that Musk can skip future testimonies for this case, he would be better off heeding Beeler's advice, regardless. \"It seems unlikely there's going to be any more hassle,\" the judge added, should the world's richest man \"work it out\" with the SEC.

Under the current accounting regime, firms such as Tesla and Block that hold Bitcoin must report a loss in earnings reports if the digital asset drops in value during a given time. At the same time, they can't record a profit if the price goes up. In practice, this means that a company that bought Bitcoin at $25,000 and saw it dip to $20,000 must maintain the lower value on its balance sheet\u2014even if the price soars to $40,000 right after.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin, which jumped on the FASB news, was a little over $42,000 at midday on Wednesday. Tesla owns around 10,000 while Block has about 8,000, and as both firms acquired most or all or their Bitcoin holdings at a lower price, they stand to reap a gain when the new rules are enacted, according to FASB, \"for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\"\n\nThe forthcoming rule changes have been expected for months, but the share price of MicroStrategy nonetheless jumped 5% on the news.

There were strong words exchanged. The next day, Twitter Spaces was temporarily disabled. Then, was also the time when non-paid, legacy verified accounts could briefly regain their blue check by editing their bio.\n\nElon Musk says X is bringing video to Spaces soon","Entities":["Elon Musk","Elon Musk's","Jason Calacanis","ElonJet","Spaces","Twitter","Musk","Twitter Spaces"]}

Looking back at growth stocks and charting their winning history can be a handy little experiment. Especially with a modest \u00a31,000 lump sum. As investors we have limited funds, but so many options.\n\nThere\u2019s also an easy lesson to learn about leadership. As a CEO there could hardly be a more divisive figure than Elon Musk.\n\nMy wife, for example, thinks he\u2019s a dangerous chancer. My friend Eric, who owns a Model S, hangs on his every word.\n\nWhatever your opinion, one thing is quite clear. If I\u2019d invested \u00a31,000 into Tesla on the day of its stock market debut, I probably wouldn\u2019t be writing this article now.\n\nInstead I might be pouring champagne on my breakfast cereal, and probably awaiting delivery of my Cybertruck.\n\nTesla\u2019s June 2010 initial public offering (IPO) will go down in history for a couple of reasons. To start with, it became the first US carmaker to go public since Ford in 1956.\n\nSecond, the company was wildly unprofitable at the time.\n\nTesla would rack up net losses of $3.2bn (\u00a32.5bn) before ever turning a profit. The company lost money for 26 financial quarters in a row. That\u2019s more than six years for investors holding a loss-making stock!\n\nAnd yet the South African CEO is now the richest man in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth is around \u00a3200bn, give or take a few million here or there.\n\nHis ownership stakes in SpaceX and Tesla account for most of this wealth. The rocket and space exploration company is worth around $175bn, but is not publicly traded. The electric car and battery storage brand? From unlikely beginnings it has forced its way into the top 10 most valuable companies in the world.\n\nTesla went public at $17 a share on its debut. But it also underwent a five-for-one stock split in 2020, then another three-for-one stock split in 2022.\n\nA \u2018stock split\u2019 is when a business increases the number of shares available to buy and sell on the market. Early investors got their share allocation quintupled, then tripled again. So to be accurate, we need to divide the IPO price of $17 a share by 15. Because one share of Tesla would be equivalent","Entities":["Elon Musk","SpaceX","the Bloomberg Billionaires Index","Eric","Ford","Tesla","IPO","Cybertruck","US","Model S"]}

The man, Ben Brody, was not even in the same state where the brawl occurred.\n\nBrody said he and his family faced harassment from those who believed Musk's absurd claims.\n\n\u201cMy family and I are just being harassed completely, and I would be more than happy to clear up any confusion if necessary,\u201d Brody said in a video he posted to clear his name at the time. \u201cThis is just so ridiculous, and I","Entities":["Elon Musk","Vox Populi","Allen","Justine","neo-Nazis","Texas","Alex Jones'","Jones","Alex Jones","The New York Times'","Ben Brody","Twitter","Musk","Vox Dei","Brody"]}

But I think they are missing the point. Tesla isn't simply a car company. It's on the point of being one of the world's most advanced AI technology firms.\n\nI started buying the shares during the technology sector decline around 2021. I was late to the party but still got a good deal and have seen sizeable returns since. The good news is I reckon the party's not over yet.\n\nWhy I think Tesla is awesome\n\nAlthough the company is known for its electric vehicles, it is branching into autonomous taxi services. CEO Elon Musk mentioned recently that such a service could involve a 50\/50 revenue split with vehicle owners.\n\nMy main concern with this is the company is dealing with challenging regulations. Such regulations are evolving and differ depending on country and jurisdiction, so I think it will take time to see a global fleet of robotaxis by Tesla. That means a really strong return from my Tesla shares could take time.\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Investment Management, an advanced technology investment company, shares my enthusiasm for Musk's company. Tesla makes up around 8% of ARKK, Wood's most popular exchange-traded fund.\n\nNow, ARKK is currently down around 70% since February 2021. But Wood's firm owns some very volatile companies, not all of which I agree with. But I think the future of Tesla in her portfolios has a lot of strength.\n\nIf you've ever been in a Tesla, you know how different the experience is. I once joked with a taxi driver that he could drive his Tesla to my destination by just looking at the screen. The whole road \u2014 pedestrians and all \u2014 was shown.\n\nI think this fun, advanced, and technologically superior strategy sets Tesla apart.\n\nHowever, Musk recently warned that the company's new Cybertruck will have a negative cash flow until mid-to-late 2024. That does concern me slightly.\n\nWord on the Street\n\nWall Street has a range of views on Tesla. Analysts from Wedbush Jefferies, and HSBC have revised earnings estimates for the company downward. They also expect short-term revenue growth to slow.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Cathie Wood","AI","Wood","Ark Investment Management","Tesla","HSBC","Wedbush Jefferies","Cybertruck","Musk","ARKK"]}

At the moment, it's certainly not top of my list.\n  Valuation metrics\n  Tesla's valuation metrics are outstandingly expensive. The Elon Musk company trades at 77 times TTM (trailing 12 month) earnings and 89.4 times forward earnings.\n  While it's one of only a few electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers to be profitable, it's very hard to see much justification for the valuation.\n  We may assume therefore that Tesla's growth prospects must be excellent. Otherwise investors wouldn't be willing to pay a premium for the stock.\n  Well, even using the price\/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which is adjusted for growth over the coming five years, it's not cheap. The stock has a PEG ratio of 3.9.\n  Anything above one normally suggests a company is overvalued. As such, Tesla looks particularly expensive.\n  Of course, it's worth considering that investors are paying for growth beyond the next five years. By then, Tesla's autonomous cars and taxis should be contributors to net income.\n  While I want to believe in the Tesla project, and I hope to see Musk's visions become a reality, I'm not sure I can put my money behind it.","Entities":["PEG","Tesla","EV","TTM","Musk"]}

Year to date, it's up about 95%.\n Can shares in the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer keep rising in the near term? Here's my share price forecast for 2024.\n  Long-term potential\n  From a long-term investing perspective, Tesla is a stock I'm growing increasingly bullish on.\n  What excites me about the company is its \u2018Dojo' artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Described by legendary growth fund manager Cathie Wood as the \u201c largest AI project in the world \u201d, Dojo is a supercomputer designed to help Tesla develop its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.\n  In the long run, this technology could give Tesla a big edge over its rivals, and help it roll out \u2018robotaxis' and other autonomous driving services.\n  Short-term uncertainty\n  In the short term however, the company is facing some challenges. Today, Tesla is in the business of selling pretty standard EVs.\n  And there are a few issues to be aware of here. Firstly, consumers are cutting back on big-ticket expensive purchases right now due to high interest rates.\n  Secondly, drivers appear to be cooling on EVs due to factors like affordability, range anxiety, and a lack of charging networks.\n  Third, Tesla is now facing an intense level of competition. As a result, it's cutting its prices.\n  It's worth pointing out that the company is still expected to generate solid top- and bottom-line growth next year. Currently, analysts expect revenue to rise about 21% and earnings per share (EPS) to grow about 23%.\n  The three factors I mentioned above add some uncertainty to these forecasts, however. And when it comes to working out a share price target for Tesla, they need to be considered.\n  My share price forecast\n  Now, to calculate my share price forecast, I'm going to use a simple \u2018earnings multiplier' approach.\n  This involves taking next year's consensus EPS forecast and applying a certain multiple to it.\n  Looking at analysts' estimates, the consensus EPS forecast is currently $3.84 (I'm going to assume this is accurate, but it may not be).","Entities":["Dojo","Cathie Wood","EPS","AI","Tesla","Full Self-Driving","EV","FSD"]}

Meanwhile, others \u2014 like Cathie Wood \u2014 think the Tesla share price will go up due to investors' optimism.\n\nA key reason for the pessimism came from Elon Musk himself. He admitted that the Cybertruck would take a financial toll on Tesla, be hard to scale for production, and won't be cash flow positive until 2025.\n\nIn two years, Musk projects that the company can begin mass producing the Cybertruck at 250,000 units. Analysts estimate the price to be around $60,990. With two million pre-orders of the Cybertruck already, this means $15.2bn in revenue in 2025. Not bad. However, a few things might shatter this dream.\n\nFirst, the car was projected to cost only $39,000 when unveiled in 2019. It received much acclaim because it would cost $10,000 less than the most popular pickup truck (the Ford F150 ) while being significantly more modern. However, Tesla will likely release the Cybertruck at around $60,990 because of rising material costs. Its direct competitors have also been forced to price their trucks at around the same price.\n\nMoreover, Musk has repeatedly stressed that it would be tough to scale production, since the Cybertruck is so advanced that the manufacturing process will be very different from its production of saloons. Overall, both the demand and supply of Cybertrucks are in jeopardy.\n\nIn addition, Tesla's free cash flow \u2014 which is the key number used to value companies \u2014 has already declined due to the price cuts and operating expenses from the Cybertruck and AI, resulting in earnings decreasing by 44% year on year. With even more investment needed to scale production of the Cybertruck , it will continue to decrease free cash flow and I believe worsen the valuation and sentiment in the short term.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Cathie Wood","AI","Ford","Tesla","Cybertruck","F150","Musk"]}

Some of my fellow car enthusiast friends gave me a hard time about my choice. They compared it to cooking in a microwave versus a Viking Professional oven. However, I maintained my position for many reasons.\n\nTeslas are fast and responsive and once you get used to one-pedal driving, the convenience is a game-changer. Plus, the savings can't be beat \u2014 and go well beyond skipping the fuel pump. Here's how I saved money by owning a Tesla\n\n1. Sticker Price\nOne of the top arguments about buying a Tesla is that you pay a premium for gas savings. However, I disagree. A 2023 Model Y Long Range's MSRP starts at $37,890. When including taxes and upgrades I paid roughly $45,000. Models along that price point include a Subaru Outback Limited, Audi A3 or Lexus UX.\n\n2. Lower Fuel Costs\nThe most obvious and significant way owning a Tesla saves money is by getting rid of fuel costs . Unlike traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, Teslas run entirely on electricity. The cost of electricity is substantially lower than gasoline, depending on your location and energy rates. Charging your Tesla at home can be significantly cheaper, and many workplaces and public charging stations offer free or low-cost charging options.\n\nI installed a Tesla wall charger for roughly $600. The charger was $425 and professional installation was $175. My Tesla is programmed to charge at night to be ready to go in the mornings. I'm on my local energy company's EV program which gives me reduced rates between 10:01 p.m. and 8 a.m.","Entities":["Lexus","Tesla","EV","Audi A3","Teslas","Subaru Outback Limited","UX"]}

This in itself marked an incredible run, since it underwent its IPO in July 2010. In just shy of a decade, investors from the very beginning saw the stock rise by over 2,000%. However, even if you missed out on that initial run, you'd have been greatly rewarded if you invested at the start of 2020. The stock has increased by 691% since then. For perspective, if I'd invested \u00a310,000 then, I'd have \u00a369,103 today. My money would've risen almost sevenfold, which is quite incredible. However, is Tesla stock still worth investing in today? Will it generate similar returns going forward? I'll be looking at these questions below.\n\nThe future of Tesla? With a market cap of just over $740bn, Tesla is already one of the most valuable companies in the world. If it were to grow at the same rate it has since 2020, it would be valued at more than $5.1trn by 2027. This would make it one of the most valuable companies in history \u2014 and almost $2.2trn more than Apple, the current most valuable company in the world. In my eyes, this is inconceivable. I don't just believe it can't reach this valuation in the next four years. I don't even believe it can achieve this in the next 10 years. Firstly, it would require monstrous growth to even be in the conversation of justifying this. While it has been able to grow revenue rapidly from \u00a324.6bn at the end of 2019 to \u00a395.9bn in the trailing 12 months, it's difficult to see this level of expansion continue. Recent news of the electric vehicle market experiencing a slowdown in growth is an indicator. Furthermore, in the latest quarter, revenue only increased by 9% year on year. Secondly, it's not trading cheaply. With a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 78, it's very difficult to see room for its stock to grow. Unfortunately, I think the boat has passed for investors to generate life-changing returns with Tesla stock. In fact, I don't think it'll generate investors any meaningful returns over the next few years. It's a highly expensive stock that isn't growing anywhere near fast enough to justify its valuation.","Entities":["Apple","Tesla","IPO"]}

The electric vehicles (EV) market it operates in has the weight of major governments pushing it forward, and the share price has surged for years and years.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a thought exercise for me, either. I own Tesla shares and I\u2019m curious to see how my investment performed this year. I\u2019m equally curious to explore whether it\u2019s still a good buy, or whether it might be time to sell.\n\n\u00a32,500 in Tesla\n\nMy example stake will be \u00a32,500 invested at the start of the year. Interestingly, early January was a two-year low for the stock. The share price briefly dipped to just $108 from its $407 all-time high in 2021. So it was a good time to buy.\n\nThis \u00a32,500 stake, if bought on the first trading day of January, would have turned into \u00a35,616 up to today.

Firstly, high interest rates make borrowing more expensive. This could impact sales of Tesla\u2019s EVs, which some might call an expensive toy compared to a cheaper second-hand combustion vehicle. Second, the signs are there \u2013 like Shell\u2019s recent pullback from renewables \u2013 that the Net Zero targets many governments have are going to be delayed or sidelined.\n\nBoth these issues are going to make me think carefully about","Entities":["Apple","Tesla","Meta","HSBC","EV","Shell","US"]}

The electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer already has a strong presence in China\u2019s premium market segment and ambitious international expansion plans suggest NIO stock could have a bright future.\n\nHowever, while both firms enjoyed explosive share price growth during the pandemic, the US giant\u2019s held on to its gains more successfully than NIO. Over five years, the Tesla share price has advanced 906%, compared to just 6% for its Chinese rival.\n\nSo, is NIO stock cheaper today? Here\u2019s what the charts say.\n\nAs the chart above shows, Tesla\u2019s grown over 11.5 times larger in five years. A $65bn market cap back in November 2018 has ballooned to over $754bn today.\n\nTherefore, Tesla\u2019s a far bigger industry player than NIO. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a better company per se, but potential investors should note that it benefits from economies of scale that NIO doesn\u2019t.\n\nIndeed, recent price cuts across its range of vehicles serve as good examples of the US giant exercising its muscle in the increasingly competitive EV market. After initially resisting, NIO subsequently followed suit by slashing $4.2k from the price of all models a few months ago.\n\nHowever, as mentioned, NIO isn\u2019t profitable. In fact, it currently loses $35,000 on each car it sells. In addition, the company\u2019s gross margins have been lower than Tesla\u2019s for the past five years \u2014 often substantially lower.\n\nHowever, the European Union\u2019s now launching an investigation into the Chinese government\u2019s activities in the EV sector. This could lead to tariff impositions in NIO\u2019s crucial European markets. CEO William Li has also been highly critical of perceived US protectionism in recent months.\n\nUltimately, such political tensions could be an unwelcome headwind for the company as it tries to expand its international footprint. After all, NIO\u2019s yet to export a single car to the massive American market.\n\nNIO might look cheaper than Tesla on some traditional valuation metrics. That shouldn\u2019t be discounted lightly. However, on questions of profitability and market dominance, Tesla looks the better company to me.\n\nI have concerns about the valuations of both EV shares at today\u2019s prices, so I\u2019m keeping this pair on my watchlist for now.

The Model 3 fell from $48,000 to $44,380. The luxury Model S, meanwhile, plunged from a high of $130,000 to $96,380. The cars, as they say, have been priced to move.\nIt's an unusual business strategy, to put it mildly. \"I can't think of another point in the history of automotive when a brand that wasn't going out of business cut prices 20% a year,\" Mark Schirmer, the director of communications at the research firm Cox Automotive, told me. Tesla is hoping that lower prices will drive up sales and slow the advance of the company's rivals \u2014 maybe even scare some of them out of the market altogether.\nBut that's not what's happening. Lower prices are not translating into higher sales. The number of cars Tesla delivered to customers in the third quarter actually declined. Revenue is dropping, and the company's once fat profit margins are getting squeezed \u2014 down to 17.9% in the third quarter, compared with 25.1% a year ago. Competitors aren't being driven out of business, either. Once totally dominant in the EV space, Tesla's share of the US market has fallen from 62% at the beginning of the year to only 50% today.\nTo make matters worse, the public's appetite for EVs isn't growing as fast as automakers expected. That means Tesla has set off a protracted battle for a piece of a pie that's growing crumb by crumb.\n\"If you do the price war, you have to make sure you have enough volume to increase and maintain profitability,\" John Zhang, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, said. \"It has to be a continuous battle. This war you have to wage all the way. And you need to plan ahead. That's how you win.\"\nConversely, some experts will tell you that price wars are unwinnable \u2014 that they're a race to the bottom that serves only to kill profitability for the entire industry. And in an industry where the underlying technology \u2014 and, thus, the costs of production \u2014 are changing rapidly, no one can be sure where the bottom is. Winnable or not, Musk chose a terrible time to pick a fight.

The company just updated its Motor Vehicle Order Agreement ahead of the first Cybertruck deliveries, which it said last month are on track for November 30.\n\nUnder the terms, which have been making the rounds on social media this weekend, Tesla states that it \u201cmay seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the Vehicle\u201d if buyers breach its resale provision, or it may \u201cdemand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater.\u201d The terms also warn that offending resellers could be barred from buying vehicles from Tesla in the future.\n\nTesla says it may grant exceptions to some people wishing to sell their Cybertruck within the first year, but they must get written consent. If the company does agree, it will either buy the car back at a reduced price \u2014 deducting $0.25 per mile driven, plus wear and tear, and the cost of any necessary repairs \u2014 or allow the owner to resell the truck to a third-party buyer. Tesla's Cybertruck is only being released to a small number of select customers at first and won't enter mass production until 2024, so naturally, the company is trying to get ahead of resellers looking to cash in on the vehicle's rarity.","Entities":["Tesla","Vehicle","Cybertruck","Motor Vehicle Order Agreement"]}

Investors were clearly feeling skittish after Tesla reported a gross margin of 17.9%, down from 25.1% in the same period last year. That's also down from Q2's margins of 18.2%. As a result, profits fell 44% to $1.85 billion in Q3 from the same year-ago period.\n\nInvestors see the falling margins and Tesla's price cuts as proof that demand is lessening for the vehicles as other EVs take market share and rising interest rates make it difficult for many buyers to afford big ticket purchases. The company also reported that solar deployments slipped 48% in Q3 from the same period last year. But the company made up for it by pulling in a 90% spike in energy storage deployments.","Entities":["Q3","Tesla"]}

The Model Y topped the charts, with around 200,000 of these cars making it to U.S. roads.\n\nThis is great news for Tesla and for the takeup of cleaner EVs as a whole. EVs, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell vehicles account for 8.9% of the whole motoring sector and have seen a 2.6 percentage-point increase from the same period a year ago, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, but the news does present some potential roadblocks for competitors.\n\nAccording to Reuters, if vehicle manufacturing doesn't reach 80% of capacity, assembly plants will typically not turn a profit. This might discourage other brands from focusing on electric models if the sales don't match the ambition.\n\nReuters pointed to Ford pausing the construction of a $3.5 billion EV battery plant as a signal that some rivals might be discouraged from increasing their EV stock with Tesla dominating a market that is still developing.","Entities":["the Alliance for Automotive Innovation","U.S.","Chevrolet","Tesla","Ford","EV","Michigan","Reuters","Model","the United States"]}

The end result is an incredible amount of wasted materials.

Tesla (TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected deliveries in its third quarter as factory upgrades impacted some production.\n\nTSLA\nTesla ( TSLA ) introduced a cheaper new version of its popular Model Y SUV just in time to address what some are calling a slowing in EV sales around the globe.\nTesla now lists on its US website the Model Y RWD (rear-wheel drive) model, which is a version of the Model Y with a single motor powering its rear axle. Tesla estimates the Model Y RWD will have 260 miles of range and cost $43,990. Prior to the RWD version, Tesla had a base Model Y AWD (all-wheel drive) that cost $47,490, or $3,500 more than this new RWD version.\nThe new variant will likely be powered by cheaper LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries, which have shorter range but longer battery life compared to NMC (nickel manganese cobalt) batteries. Tesla says the new RWD also qualifies for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, meaning this version could be had for as little as $36,490 if the buyers meet income requirements. Buyers' AGI (adjusted gross income) shouldn't exceed $150,000 for a single person or $300,000 for joint filers\/married people.\nTesla didn't indicate where the Model Y RWD is assembled, though it is possible it will be made in Giga Austin, which currently only builds the Model Y and potentially the Cybertruck when production commences. Tesla does however make a Model Y RWD that is assembled in China, as well as at Tesla's newer Berlin gigafactory\nThe introduction of a new Model Y comes as Tesla's global sales missed analyst expectations for the third quarter. Tesla said it delivered 435,059 vehicles globally , of which approximately 419,000 were Model Y and Model 3 vehicles and around 16,000 were higher-priced Model X and Model S cars. Wall Street consensus estimates had deliveries pegged at 456,722.\n\u201cA sequential decline in volumes was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades, as discussed on the most recent earnings call.

In the past five years alone, Tesla shares have soared by 1,340%.\n\nThat means that, if I had put \u00a31,000 into the shares five years ago, I would now be sitting on a Tesla holding worth over \u00a314,000.

That might not even be due to its own making. For example, if soaring lithium prices made electric vehicles uneconomic or a recession hurt demand for new cars, Tesla could fare badly.\n\nThat is why smart investors all diversify across a range of shares.","Entities":["Tesla"]}

He believes Musk\u2019s adventurous spirit and lack of empathy are largely a result of his traumatic childhood memories, especially of his father, Errol Musk.\n\n\u201cIt has left deep scars on him, the way his father treated him when he was bullied on the schoolyard, when his face was pounded into the concrete steps, and his father took the side of the person who beat him up instead of Elon,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cHe says to me, \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t have as much empathy. I\u2019m not like you. I don\u2019t want the person in front of me just to love me. I got to get this mission done.\u201d\n\nIsaacson\u2019s new book, Elon Musk, will arrive at bookstores nationwide on Sept. 12. He has been sharing snippets of the book on social media since August. Last week, Isaacson published an adapted excerpt in TIME magazine about Musk\u2019s clash with other tech leaders over artificial intelligence.

The two were discussing revelations in Walter Isaacson's new biography on Elon Musk, released tomorrow, that the billionaire sabotaged a Ukrainian attack on the Russian navy in Crimea by refusing to enable access to the Starlink satellite network on the peninsula \u2013 a network Musk owns and a fact he himself has confirmed.\n\nAfter saying he \u201ccan't speak to a specific episode,\u201d Blinken seemingly praised Musk's willingness to even allow the Ukrainians access, saying \u201cStarlink has been a vital tool for\u2026 particularly the [Ukrainian] military to communicate in their effort to defend all of Ukraine's territory.\u201d This, of course, ignores the fact that Crimea is Ukrainian territory illegally annexed and occupied by Russia in 2014.\n\nIf that sounds like an ungenerous rebuke from the CNN anchor, it isn't. Last month, in a lengthy investigative piece for The New Yorker, journalist Ronan Farrow reported that US government officials \u201cnow treat [Musk] like a sort of unelected official\u201d because of the power he wields. Investing in areas where state investment has receded following decades of neoliberal privatization, such as in electric cars and, yes, Starlink, Musk has made himself and his companies indispensable to US national security and other policy priorities.\n\nIt also concerns foreign governments and allies, including Ukraine, which The New York Times reported in July has raised concerns over Musk's control of Starlink with Washington. \u201cAt least nine countries \u2013 including in Europe and the Middle East \u2013 have also brought up Starlink with American officials over the past 18 months, with some questioning Mr. Musk's power over the technology,\u201d The Times reported, quoting two US intelligence officials who were briefed on these discussions.

It's not clear whether this particular vehicle reflects how the Cybertruck will look once Tesla finally gets around to delivering them en masse. Though the pics were taken through the windshield and front windows, we can also clearly see the dash is as sparsely designed as ever, which tracks with the direction Tesla is taking the Model 3 with its first big refresh.\n\nThe new photos may have satiated Tesla stans for the moment, but all of them really just want deliveries to start. With summer nearly in the rearview mirror \u2014 which would mark another missed deadline \u2014 it's unclear just when that will happen. Judging from a company-wide email reportedly sent by Musk last month, delays may be due to the automaker's struggles to get all the parts to fit together just right, aesthetically speaking.

According to an excerpt CNN reported on, Musk allegedly told SpaceX workers to shut down Starlink access close to the Crimea coast to prevent a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's naval fleet.\n\nMusk, who has reportedly been in contact with Russian officials including President Vladimir Putin, is said to have been worried that the attack would lead to Russia retaliating with nuclear weapons. Ukrainian leaders seemingly begged Musk to reactivate Starlink access but drones that were approaching Russian warships \u201clost connectivity and washed ashore harmlessly,\u201d CNN cites Isaacson as stating.\n\nMusk's alleged actions have had significant consequences for Ukraine, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Podolyak wrote on X (the platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk owns) that in preventing drones from attacking the Russian ships, Musk enabled them to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities. \"As a result, civilians, children are being killed,\" Podolyak claimed. \"This is the price of a cocktail of ignorance and big ego.\"\n\nAccording to Musk, however, Starlink was not active in those areas and so SpaceX had nothing to disable. \u201cThere was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol. The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,\" he wrote on X. \"If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how he's framing the situation, Musk has admitted to making another decision that has impacted the Ukraine-Russia conflict in one way or another. A report late last year indicated that around 1,300 Starlink terminals Ukraine was using temporarily went offline due to a dispute over payments for the internet service.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Vladimir Putin","CNN","Mykhailo Podolyak","Isaacson","Crimea","Walter Isaacson's","Podolyak","Starlink","Volodymyr Zelensky","Twitter","Ukraine","Musk","Russia"]}

The shares surged and investors saw huge returns as the firm became the main player in the electric vehicle (EV) market. And still, all that might pale into insignificance compared to what's to come.\n\nThe car maker is poised for big things, and there's a multi-billion dollar reason why I'd buy in today.\n\nTo explain what that reason is, let's recap a little. The important detail is that Tesla dominates the EV space at the moment. And even that might be understating it.\n\nOn margins alone, the firm is light years ahead of anyone else. Nio ? Hasn't turned a profit yet. Rivian ? Hasn't turned a profit yet. Tesla? Making oodles of cash on every car it sells.\n\nIn 2022, the average margin on Tesla EVs was $9,800. For context, the margin on an average Toyota is $1,200. So even compared to legacy ICE (internal combustion engine) cars, it's way ahead.\n\nTesla pulls this off thanks to some unique advantages. For one, it sidesteps the dealership model of selling cars. Selling directly means higher margins. Another is that it spends nothing on advertising. The firm relies on word-of-mouth and, let's face it, Elon Musk's Twitter (or X) profile.\n\nCheap prices\n\nThese big margins led Tesla owner Musk to reduce prices this year. Its Model Y dropped from $64,990 to $47,740. That's a steep drop and looks even steeper in a year of such high inflation.\n\nBased on projected deliveries, these cuts might drop the bottom line by as much as $3bn this year. At first glance, it seems a strange move. A bad one, even. Why give up all those earnings? Well, the answer might be a great reason to buy in here. Here's why.\n\nCheap prices can help Tesla continue to dominate market share. This helps the firm in a few ways.\n\nFor one, more of its cars on the road means more use of its Supercharger charging network. If Tesla's network becomes the industry norm then it would be a major source of revenue.\n\nAlso, more cars means more data. That data could be used to steal a march as self-driving vehicles are introduced. Could Tesla dominate this market too? I'd like to be a shareholder if so.","Entities":["Elon Musk's","Twitter","Toyota","Tesla EVs","Tesla","EV","Model Y","ICE","Musk"]}

But it appears that's not the only thing that X plans to do with user data. According to an update to another section of the policy, the company additionally plans to use the information it collects and other publicly available information to help train its machine learning and AI models, it says.\n\nAs Ivanovs points out, X owner Elon Musk has ambitions to enter the AI market with another company, xAI. This leads him to theorize that Musk likely intends to use X as a source of data for Xai -- and perhaps Musk's recent tweet encouraging journalists to write on X was even an attempt to generate more interesting and useful data to feed into the AI models.\n\nIn fact, Musk has previously stated that xAI would use \"public tweets\" to train its AI models, so this is not much of a leap. He accused other tech giants of leveraging Twitter to train their AI models, even threatening Microsoft with a potential lawsuit for alleged illegal use of Twitter data. Musk also filed suit against unknown entities for scraping Twitter data, which also may have been for the purpose of training artificial intelligence large language models.\n\nIn addition, Ivanovs points to to the text on the xAI homepage which states that while it's a separate company from X Corp, it \"will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission.\"","Entities":["Elon Musk","AI","Ivanovs","Tesla","Microsoft","Twitter","Musk","Bloomberg","X Corp"]}

Likewise, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also opened a civil probe, the Journal said, and has sought the same information.\n  The plans for Project 42 involved building a glass structure that appeared to be a living space with bedrooms, bathrooms and a kitchen near Tesla's facilities in Austin, Texas. A couple of concepts envisioned it as a \"twisted hexagon\" or a glass cube similar to Apple's 5th Avenue store.

It's unclear if that investigation is finished and if the company's order for the special glass pushed through.\n  As the publication notes, SEC requires transactions over $120,000 when an executive has a material interest in them. Any personal benefits paid to executives that amount to over $10,000 must also be disclosed to investors. Authorities have only just started looking into the initiative, however, and these probes might not lead to any formal charges.\n  In addition to investigations regarding Project 42, Tesla is also reportedly facing inquiries from federal prosecutors over the driving range of its vehicles.

Yoon claims her husband survived the initial crash, but was trapped in the fast-burning vehicle.

The flammable gas can ignite from the battery's high temperature, resulting in a quick fire that's hard to put out and emits toxic fumes.\n\nTesla's batteries span the entire length and width of the floor of its vehicles, making a fire that much more encompassing.\n\nFirefighters used more than 1,000 gallons of water to extinguish the fire.\n\nYoon alleges that Tesla is strictly liable for her husband's death. She accuses the automaker of making a vehicle that is defective in its design and manufacture, and is not crashworthy. Yoon also alleges that Tesla is guilty of negligence and breach of implied warranty of merchantability.\n\nThe plaintiff demands a jury trial and is asking for all damages recoverable by law, including actual damages, lost wages and earning capacity, loss of parental guidance, emotional distress, punitive damages and more.","Entities":["Jiyoung Yoon","Rebecca Bellan","Tesla","The Daily Voice","New York","Rockland County","the U.S. District Court","Jyung Woo Hahn","the Palisades Interstate Parkway"]}

A recent, wide-ranging update to Beijing's anti-espionage legislation is also prompting foreign firms to take a closer look at the risks of operating in the country that has turned national security into a top priority.\n\nForeign automakers have been in China for decades, but internet-connected vehicles have given rise to a slew of new data compliance requirements that did not affect traditional carmakers. Tesla has already encountered data security backlashes in the country.\n\nOver the past weekend, local media reported that an airport in a southern city with a one-million population had banned Tesla vehicles from parking due to \"confidentiality concerns,\" though drop-offs and pick-ups are still allowed. An airport worker told the press that \"many places have a similar rule.\"\n\nThe policy is supposedly a response to Tesla's \"sentry mode.\" The feature, which uses a car's external cameras to detect suspicious activity when the vehicle is left unattended, is designed to guard against break-ins and thefts. And despite similar features in other local EV makers, Tesla's foreign identity clearly results in more trust issues.\n\nIn response to the media attention, Tesla stated in a Weibo post that data generated from Sentry Mode is \"only stored offline on the USB device inside the car,\" and, unlike some other brands, \"neither the owner nor Tesla\" can remotely view the vehicle's surroundings online.","Entities":["China","Weibo","Tesla","EV","Beijing","Mode"]}

Three owners in California have launched a proposed class action lawsuit accusing Tesla of false advertising. The trio claims their cars fell well short of their estimated ranges, and that they've had no success lodging complaints. The customers either wouldn't have bought their cars or would have paid considerably less for them, according to the suit.\n\nThe owners allege Tesla committed fraud, violated warranties and conducted unfair competition. If the lawsuit gets class action status, it would cover all people in California who bought a Tesla Model 3, Model S, Model X or Model Y. The plaintiffs are hoping for unspecified damages. Tesla has disbanded its communications team and isn't available for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit follows a Reuters report that Tesla began modifying EV ranges about a decade ago. Its cars would supposedly show inflated figures when fully charged, and would only start showing accurate numbers under a 50 percent charge. To head off complaints, the automaker is said to have created a \"Diversion Team\" that would persuade users to drop range-related support calls.\n\nIt's not certain that Tesla still uses these purported exaggerations. The Environmental Protection Agency did ask the company to trim its range estimates from the 2020 model year forward, and South Korea recently issued a $2.2 million fine over an alleged failure to adequately inform customers that EV ranges would drop in cold weather.\n\nTesla isn't alone in boasting EV range estimates that don't hold up in real conditions. An SAE International study found that electric cars tend to fall about 12.5 percent short of their advertised ranges. The report and lawsuit suggest Tesla's figures are less accurate than for other brands, however, and that the company may have tried to silence unhappy customers.","Entities":["The Environmental Protection Agency","Tesla","South Korea","SAE International","EV","Reuters","Model S","California","Model Y."]}

The remarks are the latest example of Musk calling out the \u201cApp Store tax\u201d Apple takes from in-app purchases.\n\nMusk framed the ask as part of a broader effort to help creators get paid more for paying subscribers. \u201cWhile we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the [first] 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cApple does take 30%, but I will speak with @tim_cook and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30% of what X keeps in order to maximize what creators receive.\u201d\n\nIt's unclear if Musk's request has any chance of success. Cook seems unlikely to make such a concession, as he's long ducked criticism from numerous other developers about the App Store's fees and the policies surrounding them. Apple and X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, it's not the first time Musk has publicly called out Apple's App Store policies. He previously complained about Apple's \u201csecret 30% tax\u201d on in-app purchases, and reportedly delayed the launch of Twitter Blue to avoid the fees. He's also accused the iPhone maker of threatening \u201cto withhold\u201d Twitter's from the App Store, though he later said that was a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d after a private meeting with Cook.\n\nRegardless, Musk and X would greatly benefit from a boost in paying subscribers, which seems to be the motivation for Musk again calling attention to the issue. The company's ad revenue is down more than 50 percent as many advertisers have yet to return to spending at the same level as before he took over Twitter. Generating more subscribers\u2014 via creators and Twitter Blue \u2014 could help the company become less reliant on ad revenue, though the company would need tens of millions of subscribers, if not more, to make up the deficit.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Apple","Twitter Blue","iPhone","Tim Cook","App Store","Twitter","Musk","Cook"]}

While big ticket names such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla get all the attention, the fact is that only in the U.S. have more than 500 employees. Yet, as any fan of the stock market would point out, the biggest companies are often the most valuable or have the most value. And, most of the biggest companies are often either state backed or publicly traded as back of the envelope estimates show that the top ten largest companies in the world in revenue terms are publicly traded.\n\nGoing public brings a multitude of benefits for both the firm and the investors that buy its shares. For the firm owners, if the initial public offering (IPO) is successfully executed and a strong business plan generates interest, then their shareholdings can significantly appreciate in value. As a simple example, consider the fact that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Mr. Elon Musk became the company's majority shareholder in less than two years after it was incorporated by just pitching in $6.5 million in a Series A funding round. Now, Musk's current stake in America's largest electric vehicle manufacturer is worth a rather sizeable $190 billion. On a side note, Tesla has also limited the ability of shares that have been pledged for loans and can be collateralized to less than 25% of the stock unless less than $3.5 billion, interesting considering the fact that Musk has of his Tesla stock.\n\nSo, back to IPOs. Tesla went public in 2010 and since then the stock is up by more than 20,000% - which turns a dollar invested back then to more than $200. Not bad considering that only a few companies can beat or match this performance. For instance, the most expensive share on the stock market is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), whose gains on the market since stock started trading turn a dollar back then into more than $500 now, similar to the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but significantly less than Apple's.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Apple","NYSE","NVIDIA","America","U.S.","Tesla","IPO","NVIDIA Corporation","Berkshire Hathaway Inc.","Microsoft","Musk","NVDA","Tesla, Inc."]}

This month Musk announced that Twitter would be rebranded as \u201cX\u201d, under plans to turn the platform into a Chinese-style super-app.\n\nThe letter was sent by Alex Spiro of US law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, one of Musk\u2019s main lawyers who also sent a legal warning to Meta this month over its launch of Threads \u2013 the \u201cTwitter killer\u201d app.\n\nThe letter to CCDH also threatens legal action, stating that X is considering whether what it describes as CCDH\u2019s \u201cfalse and misleading claims\u201d are actionable under the Lanham Act, a piece of US legislation that covers trademark law. It adds: \u201cPlease be advised that Twitter will employ any and all legal tools at its disposal to prevent false or misleading claims from harming its users, platform, or business.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Spiro accused CCDH of making a \u201cseries of troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically\u201d. In its last published set of annual results, advertising accounted for 90% of Twitter\u2019s $5.1bn in revenue but advertisers have held back spending since the takeover because of concerns over Musk\u2019s ownership and content moderation standards. Musk said recently that advertising revenue at Twitter had fallen by 50%.\n\nSpiro singled out a CCDH article claiming that \u201cTwitter fails to act on 99% of Twitter Blue accounts tweeting hate,\u201d which it says was based on CCDH staff reporting 100 tweets and checking whether action had been taken against them four days later. Spiro said the article provided no methodology for its selection or testing of tweets and did not explain why the 100 tweets \u2013 out of nearly 500m sent a day from the platform \u2013 were representative of Twitter\u2019s content moderation practices.\n\n\u201cThe","Entities":["Spiro","CCDH","Twitter Blue","Quinn Emanuel Urquhart","Imran Ahmed","Meta","Sullivan","US","Threads","Twitter","Musk","The Center for Countering Digital Hate","Alex Spiro"]}

To thwart the influx of requests and help keep costs in check, Tesla created a special \"diversion team\" dedicated to handle so-called \"range cases\" \u2014 meaning owners complaining of lower ranges than expected.\n  Diversion team members were trained to tell owners that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction. They would also provide tips to customers on how to extend range. The end goal? To cancel those appointments, which would save the company as much as $1,000 a visit, the Reuters investigation found.\n  It should be noted that Reuters reported that it is unable to determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates.\n  Tesla has been caught falsely advertising its range estimates before. As the report noted, South Korea regulators fined the Tesla earlier this year $2.1 million for falsely advertising driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission also found that Tesla failed to inform owners that cold weather can reduce its cars' range. The commission cited tests showing Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company's claimed ranges in cold weather.\n  In the U.S., Tesla has so far avoided fines by regulators. But since the 2020 model year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has required Tesla to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to use in advertising by an average of 3%.\n  One of the nagging problems with range estimates is their variability, which allows some automakers to push the boundaries of the system. While the EPA does review and approve those estimates, it allows automakers to use one of two methods to reach those figures: use a standard formula that converts fuel economy results, or conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. Tesla has always done the latter, which gives far better numbers.","Entities":["The Korea Fair Trade Commission","EPA","U.S.","Tesla","South Korea","Reuters","the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency"]}

Tesla updated its mobile app to remove appointment options for users asking about range, and instead gave them the choice of asking a company representative to call.\n\nThe complaints don't stem from technical flaws, the insiders claim.

High-profile users were told they'd lose their blue badge if they didn't purchase Twitter Blue, while being promised fewer ads in their feeds. Chaos ensued as celebs and media types roundly criticised the tactic, and Twitter had to briefly pause the rollout of the verification subscription due to impersonations and scams.\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk revealed that ad revenue on the platform had dropped by half. Twitter has historically struggled to make a profit, while rival Meta has become a digital advertising giant.

Musk calls his toddler X, instead of his full name, X \u00c6 A-12, and upon buying Twitter, he declared that he wanted to turn the company into \" X, the everything app .\" Not to mention that he already has SpaceX (get it? X?), and he just announced another company he is apparently building, which is called xAI","Entities":["Elon Musk","Mark","Zuckerberg","Meta","PayPal","FRS","buff","X \u00c6 A-12","Twitter","Mark Zuckerberg","Musk","Facebook","Elon Reeve Musk"]}

According to a new post from Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko, the number of monthly active users for his Twitter alternative has been steadily climbing over the past couple of months to have now reached 2.1 million -- or, as remarked Rochko, \"not far off from our last peak.\"\n\nPreviously, Mastodon's monthly active user numbers had peaked at 2.5 million between the months of October and November, which was shortly after Elon Musk officially took ownership of Twitter. Before, Mastodon had been a much smaller network, with approximately 300,000 monthly active users, the founder had said.\n\nThe fate of Mastodon's growth seems often to be tied to Twitter's moves -- or rather, its missteps. After Twitter's acquisition, for example, there was a bit of a Twitter exodus as longtime users rebelled against the changes that Musk soon enacted on their favorite microblogging site, ranging from widespread layoffs to erratic moves impacting Twitter's platform, policy , and product strategies, which included a mishandled relaunch of Twitter's subscription, Twitter Blue, which devalued verification by opening it up to anyone with a credit card to pay for it. That decision is still negatively affecting the Twitter experience, as the company recently admitted to having a Verified spammer problem, requiring a change to Twitter DMs.\n\nWhile some fleeing Twitter users tested out Mastodon following Musk's takeover, not all stuck with it, and, as a result, Mastodon's monthly active users dropped from the high of 2.5 million monthly users to 1.7 million as of the the beginning of this month. Other people may have drifted over to the different Twitter alternatives that had emerged, including Bluesky, T2, Spill, Post, and more. And some may have just dropped Twitter for good or significantly reduced their posting, leading Twitter traffic to decline.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Elon Musk's","Mastodon","Twitter Blue","Bluesky","Verified","Eugen Rochko","Spill, Post","Twitter","Rochko","Musk"]}

On Wednesday, Elon Musk tweeted something dumb about cartoon dog Scooby-Doo with the caption \"Doges ftw\"\u2014the latest in his periodic efforts to get the meme coin Dogecoin trending, and goose its value in the process. His Scooby tweet did the trick as the price of Dogecoin briefly spiked 3% in 15 minutes, adding around $320 million in market cap.\n\nWe've seen this dynamic play out again and again\u2014most famously after Musk talked up the Shiba Inu-themed token on Saturday Night Live\u2014but it's still not clear why he's doing it. One explanation is that it's an easy way to make money since he owns a bag of Doge. If you're Musk, it's really simple: Tweet about the token, watch the price jump, and then reap some profits before doing it again a few months later. Bloomberg's Matt Levine explored Musk's motives in a column last month:\n\n\"I assumed that Musk was not doing this obvious trade. He was certainly tweeting about Dogecoin, and he had certainly bought some Dogecoin, but I just figured that he was not in fact optimizing his financial returns on the trading-plus-tweeting. He was busy running Tesla and SpaceX and the tunnel thing and probably several other companies at the time (this was pre-Twitter); his whole schtick was about building stuff, not just dumb manipulation of meaningless abstract financial markets. Still the opportunity was so obvious!\"\n\nLevine concluded that, on balance, Musk was probably not out to manipulate the market even if a group of Doge owners filed a class action suit claiming he did. Instead, Levine figured that the billionaire was probably doing what he likes to do best: troll the hell out of people.\n\nThat's probably the best guess. I dislike Musk because he's an emotional cripple with fascist leanings who is actively destroying the world's most important news platform, but I can also see the appeal of moving markets with just a tweet. On its best days, Fortune Crypto can publish a scoop that will lead to token prices jumping or falling, but it takes days of research and effort.

If other automakers were to adopt FSD technology, they would need to onboard both Tesla's software and hardware suite. Tesla's approach to ADAS, and ultimately to autonomy, is to rely only on computer vision processing, or cameras, rather than a range of sensors like lidar and radar.\n\nDuring Wednesday's second quarter earnings call, Musk also said Tesla will allow the transfer of FSD software to new vehicles, but only in the third quarter.\n\n\"This is a one-time amnesty,\" said Musk, encouraging buyers to place their orders in Q3 or \"within reasonable delivery time frames.\" Currently, Tesla owners who have spent the $15,000 on FSD are locked into their existing car, and cannot upgrade to a new model without losing their access to the software.\n\nToday, about 400,000 Teslas have FSD onboard, according to Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report. The automaker's goal in expanding the number of cars that use the controversial software is a pure play at increasing the amount of data those cars collect of real-world driving environments.\n\nMusk touched on the importance of having vast amounts of video data to train FSD in order to eventually achieve full autonomy. Today, the automaker has accumulated 300 million miles driven in FSD, a number that Musk said \"will seem extremely small very soon.\"\n\nTesla to invest $1 billion in Dojo supercomputer\n\nThe other main piece of Tesla's reach for autonomy is having enough compute power.\n\n\"The fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training,\" said Musk. \"If we had more training compute, we could get it done faster.\"\n\nTesla also announced Wednesday that it would soon start production of its Dojo training computer. What that means, exactly, is unclear. Dojo, which Tesla announced at its AI Day in 2021, will be used to train Tesla's neural nets. Those neural nets are used to power, train and improve FSD, as well as the automaker's humanoid robot, Optimus.

As TechCrunch notes, the automaker started testing the capability in May, but now it's more widely available to Tesla customers in the US and in Canada. The number of people who can access the feature, however, likely remains pretty limited. To start with, it will only be accessible to those who have newer Teslas \u2014 2021 and later \u2014 who also have a Powerwall. That's the company's battery system that stores solar energy harnessed by solar panels.\n\nTo enable Charge on Solar, users will need to fire up their Tesla app, choose the feature and then set it up. They'll then see a slider with a sun icon within the feature's settings that they can drag left or right to set the charge limit. The vehicle will charge itself from solar and the grid like usual before it reaches the sun slider, ensuring users have enough power to get where they need to. But after reaching the sun slider, the vehicle will only charge itself using excess solar energy.\n\nThe Powerwall will still prioritize storing backup energy or charging other appliances when it's in Storm Watch mode before allocating any excess solar power for vehicle charging. Charge on Solar will truly only charge EVs using excess energy, which is also why owners worried about not having enough juice can set a time limit for it. Of course, they can also adjust their charge limit, or switch off Charge on Solar entirely if they want to be absolutely sure that their batteries will get fully charged.","Entities":["Storm Watch","Solar","Canada","Tesla","Powerwall","US","Teslas","TechCrunch"]}

But despite the program's significant payouts, some creators weren't happy -- and took their complaints to Twitter owner Elon Musk over the weekend. In a series of tweets, Musk addressed creators' concerns over things like the types of accounts that were eligible for monetization, rate limits, and other issues.\n\nMusk had said the first round of creator payouts will total $5 million and would be cumulative from February onward, TechCrunch reported last week. That's resulted in some creators seeing sizable payouts of four or even five figures, many reported on Twitter.\n\nHowever, a legacy policy was preventing some creators from becoming eligible for subscriptions if their profile featured \"animals or fictional characters,\" unless those were directly affiliated with the Twitter account's brand or organization. An account dubbed \"Battle Beagle\" -- which does not tweet about dogs, by the way, but rather largely retweets from other accounts -- pointed out this policy to Musk, to which he replied, \"Consider this silly policy deleted as of now.\"\n\nAnother issue arose from an active tweeter who said they were hitting their rate limit a lot -- an issue they shouldn't have had as a subscription-verified account. Musk replied that it should take around 8 hours of continuous scrolling to hit the limit unless Twitter was doing something wrong.\n\nTwitter had earlier enforced limits on how many tweets a user could view in light of what Musk claimed was \"extreme levels of data scraping\" from hundreds of organizations. The company had also temporarily enforced a login requirement in order to view tweets, but lifted that emergency measure back on July 5th.","Entities":["Twitter","Musk","TechCrunch","Elon Musk"]}

The decision is perhaps not pure altruism but instead, a play for Tesla to pull valuable data from other manufacturers' cars.\n\nTesla's Supercharger network stands as a testament to the company's dedication to creating a comprehensive and reliable charging infrastructure for EVs. With more than 45,000 charging stations worldwide, Tesla owners can fuel their journeys with convenient and rapid charging capabilities. By extending access to this infrastructure to competitors, Tesla not only encourages the adoption of EVs but also strives to establish a standardized and cohesive charging ecosystem that should benefit all EV drivers who want to travel without range anxiety.\n\nThe Power Of Data: Driving Tesla's Advantage\nBeyond providing charging services, Tesla's charging network acts as an invaluable source of data. Each time a vehicle charges at a Supercharger station, Tesla gathers critical information pertaining to charging patterns, user behavior and energy consumption. By offering competitors access to its infrastructure, Tesla effectively expands its pool of data, enhancing its ability to refine charging technology, optimize network efficiency and enhance the overall user experience.\n\nThe current Tesla charging cable features three larger holes to move electricity to the batteries and two smaller data port holes. Tesla uses cellular and Wi-Fi connections to \"talk\" to its cars and pull data, but the charging ports provide it with even more information. By allowing Ford Motor Co. and General Motors to use the chargers, Tesla will likely take valuable data from those companies' vehicles.\n\nWhen someone puts gas into their 2007 Toyota Camry, the only information they share is with the credit card terminal. The gas pump does not relay usage data and other information. Electric charging is different, as the battery-management system in an EV needs to relay some information to the charging source. Tesla's latest charging infrastructure transmits a trove of information, including a mix of technical data about the needed amount of charging and demographic information from the owner's payment. If Tesla's system can access a competitor's battery management system it can learn about broader charging patterns and needs. It could then sell this data to utility companies and also use it to optimize charging station locations, which could provide more profit than selling cars.\n\nFostering Standardization: A Path To Progress\nThe electric vehicle market is still in its nascent stages, and a significant obstacle hindering its growth is the absence of standardized charging infrastructure.

Between 10,000 and 20,000 are believed to have been put into UK households, according to an industry source.\n\nOwners of Tesla cars could also eventually use the service, under Ofgem plans to allow electric vehicles to sell electricity back to the grid.\n\nMr Musk earlier this year outlined a \u201cmaster plan\u201d to lead global efforts to eliminate fossil fuels, which included moving people to electric cars, massively increasing renewable generation and switching households to heat pumps.\n\nTesla launched an energy utility in Texas in December, promising to save households money by selling electricity from owners\u2019 batteries to the grid during peak times and buying it back when it is cheaper.\n\nIn Texas, the company\u2019s off peak rate is around a third below the standard rate from other energy providers. Some users have reported making more than $100 (\u00a378) by selling energy on days when a heat wave puts extra strain on the state\u2019s unreliable electricity grid.\n\nNew Tesla owners who sign up to the plan are also able to charge their electric vehicles overnight for free for the first year, which the company says saves around $360.\n\nThe \u201cvirtual power plant\u201d system is designed to eliminate the need to switch on coal and gas generation during peak times when renewable sources fail to match demand by instead pulling electricity stored in people\u2019s homes.\n\nUsers are able to track their consumption and manage bills through the Tesla app.\n\nTesla\u2019s job advert states that the company is seeking to apply to Ofgem for an electricity supply licence, which allows utilities to sell energy to domestic and non-domestic premises.","Entities":["Ofgem","Tesla","London","Britain","Texas","UK","Tesla Electric","100pc","Musk","Manchester"]}

Indeed, it\u2019s not Musk, but Meta\u2019s launch of Threads \u2013 which has 100 million-plus users in a matter of days \u2013 that could be the biggest threat to Twitter at present. Threads, though, appears to be a very different social media beast. For starters, Meta\u2019s response to Twitter is accessed through your Instagram account, meaning you can automatically follow the accounts you already follow on Instagram. And though it looks quite similar to Twitter, with short text-based posts, it differs in key ways.\n\nOne of the jokes made about Musk buying Twitter is that he\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest reply guy trying desperately to be a poster. And in Threads, we\u2019re now seeing what happens when influencers suddenly have to learn how to post. The app already has a whole bunch of inspirational \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d-style quotes often found on Instagram. They look out of place, though, in a text-focused app where the cynical and comedic shine. This will probably change if the non-Instagram-famous posters build followings on Threads, but it\u2019s not a great start.\n\nIs Threads shredding Twitter?\n\nThere are signs Threads is at least starting to hit Twitter. Matthew Prince, the CEO of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, said that Twitter\u2019s traffic levels have been tanking since the start of this year, with the biggest dip in July. In addition to threatening to sue Meta over Threads, Musk\u2019s posting through it all is also a sign it\u2019s getting under his skin. After the app was launched, Musk tweeted: \u201cCompetition is fine, cheating is not.\u201d (As my colleague Johana Bhuiyan reported, Twitter does not appear to have provided evidence of Meta having access to its IP or trade secrets.)\n\nMore Threads\n\nElon Musk, centre, and the image of Mark Zuckerberg over the Threads landing page.

The latest to hop on is Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois, who bumped up the firm's Tesla price target on Monday to $265 from $185, though the new target was 3% below Tesla's opening price of $274.43. Houchois maintained Jefferies' Hold rating on the stock, though the price hike followed a number of analysts who moved their targets higher in the wake of Tesla's strong Q2 deliveries report last week.\n\nTesla reported Q2 global production of 479,700 units with deliveries of 466,140. The delivery figure easily topped Wall Street consensus estimates of 448,599 units, as well as the prior quarter's total of 422,875. Both production and delivery totals for the second quarter were all-time records for Tesla.\n\n\u201cWe join a consensus view that Q2 will be a trough in auto gross margin,\u201d Houchois wrote, adding that the Jefferies team noted a \u201cshift\u201d in valuation drivers, notably based on Tesla's lead in AI-based self-driving software. The themes of gross margin bottoming and realization that AI was fueling Tesla's recent run-up were also noted by both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, though those banks as well as Jefferies feel that a re-rating of the stock on those themes is unwarranted at this time.\n\nFor the second quarter, Houchois forecasts a 46% jump in revenue for Tesla year over year and a 6% move higher sequentially from Q1, but he expects automotive gross margin to slip to 18.6%, which would be a substantial 40 basis points below Q1 level.\n\nAs for those huge Tesla price cuts, Houchois says the jury is still out on whether the cuts proved the elasticity of demand for Tesla vehicles, since Q2 deliveries only rose 10%. In economics, a product with elastic demand would see sales rise or fall in relation to moves in price.\n\nHouchois believes product refreshes, like the much-rumored Model 3 \u201cHighland\u201d version, and Tesla's small share overall of the mid-size car segment means there's still room to grow despite price cuts.\n\nLong term, Jefferies is still bullish on Tesla, despite the Hold rating which is likely based on valuation. Of note, Houchois says Tesla has continued to widen the gap between legacy OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)","Entities":["Philippe Houchois","AI","Tesla","Goldman Sachs","Jefferies","Houchois","Jefferies' Hold","Morgan Stanley"]}

Whether automakers switched to Tesla's charging standard. More car companies are shifting to Tesla's charging tech in the hopes of boosting their customers' confidence in going electric. Here's what it boils down to: If you currently drive a Tesla, you can keep charging at Tesla charging locations, which use the company's North American Charging Standard (NACS), which has long served it well. The chargers are thinner, more lightweight and easier to wrangle than other brands. Starting next year, if you drive a non-Tesla EV (from the automakers that have announced they'll make the switch), you'll be able to charge at all Supercharger locations with an adapter. And by 2025, EVs from some automakers won't even need an adaptor. Ford was the earliest traditional automaker to team up with Tesla for its charging tech. Current Ford EV owners \u2014 those driving a Ford electric vehicle already fitted with a CCS port \u2014 will be able to use a Tesla-developed adapter to access Tesla Superchargers starting in the spring. That means that, if you own a Mustang Mach-E or Ford F-150 Lightning, you will need the adapter in order to use a Tesla station come 2024.","Entities":["Ford F-150 Lightning","Ford","wrangle","Tesla","NACS","CCS","Mustang Mach-E","Tesla Superchargers","Ford EV"]}

Well, it appears that some plucky internet sleuths have spotted a few ways to gain unrestricted access to the platform. According to Reddit users, you can use tools like a special web browser extension or a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass Twitter's so-called rate limits. Introduced by Elon Musk late last week, the changes effectively cap the number of tweets users can view in a day. Initially, verified accounts, who pay for a Twitter Blue subscription, were limited to reading 6,000 posts per day; while others were limited to either 600 or 300 based on the age of their account. Musk later announced an increase to the limits to 10,000 for subscribers, and 1,000 and 500 for everyone else. The entrepreneur said the curbs were designed to \u201caddress extreme levels of data scraping\u201d by AI companies and \u201csystem manipulation\u201d. The limits were also imposed on TweetDeck, a dashboard that lets power users curate their Twitter experience.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Twitter Blue","AI","TweetDeck","Twitter"]}

With the stock pushing towards $300, it seems a world ago that investors were questioning whether Tesla was on the right track.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles\n\nTesla has been at the forefront of developing and promoting autonomous driving technology. It has made significant advancements in the area, with its well-known Autopilot feature.\n\nCEO Elon Musk has been vocal about his vision for self-driving cars and has set ambitious goals for Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving capabilities. He believes the company will achieve full self-driving capability this year. He\u2019s also suggested that the next Tesla vehicle would have an \u201calmost entirely autonomous mode\u201d.\n\nMusk speaks his mind. However, he has a history of overpromising and underdelivering. So, it may not be this year, and it may not be the next vehicle, but I\u2019m confident that fully-autonomous vehicles will be delivered by Tesla eventually, and likely, ahead of the competition.\n\nAnother revenue source\n\nThe leading-EV manufacturer has suggested it has plans to use autonomous vehicles as part of a ride-hailing or taxi service, similar to Uber and Bolt.\n\nMusk has previously raised the concept of a \u201cTesla Network\u201c. This would allow owners of autonomous Tesla vehicles to offer their cars as self-driving taxis when they are not being used by the owners themselves.\n\nSo, while Tesla\u2019s vehicle sales are surging today, autonomous vehicles could be an important revenue stream in just five years.\n\nIt\u2019s expensive\n\nAfter the recent surge, Tesla now trades with a forward price-to-earnings of around 90, meaning it\u2019s phenomenally expensive. However, all high-potential stocks trade at high multiples.\n\nSo, while I\u2019m optimistic about Tesla\u2019s future in autonomous vehicles, the stock has become a little expensive. I\u2019m keeping my powder dry, but the autonomous vehicle angle is something I\u2019m going to be keeping a very close eye on. If we see a smooth route to adoption, I see the share price soaring even further.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Tesla","Autopilot","Musk","Uber and Bolt"]}

The plan went into effect Friday, making Kentucky the first state to officially mandate Tesla's charging technology. Texas and Washington have also shared plans that would require charging companies to include Tesla's \"North American Charging Standard\" (NACS), as well as the Combined Charging System (CCS), if they want to qualify for federal dollars.\n\nThe Tesla charging plug swing started when Ford in May said it would build future EVs with Tesla charging technology. General Motors soon followed, causing a domino effect. Now, a range of automakers like Rivian and Volvo and charging companies like FreeWire Technologies and Volkswagen's Electrify America have said they'd adopt the NACS standard. Standards organization SAE International has also said it aims to make an industry standard configuration of NACS in six months or less.\n\nSome pockets of the EV charging industry are attempting to temper the increased NACS momentum. A group of EV charging companies like ChargePoint and ABB, as well as clean energy groups and even the Texas DOT, wrote to the Texas Transportation Commission calling for more time to re-engineer and test Tesla's connectors before implementing a proposed mandate. In a letter viewed by Reuters, they say that Texas's plan is premature and requires time to properly standardize, test and certify the safety and interoperability of Tesla's connectors.\n\nDespite pushback, it's clear that NACS is catching, at least in the private sector. If the trend of automakers and charging companies falling in line is anything to go by, we can continue to expect states to follow in Kentucky's wake.\n\nCalifornia might soon follow, since it's Tesla's birthplace, the automaker's former HQ and current \u201cengineering HQ,\u201d not to mention it leads the nation in both Tesla and EV sales. The state's DOT did not comment, and California's Department of Energy has not responded to TechCrunch's request for insights.","Entities":["Department of Energy","Volvo","Ford","Tesla","SAE International","EV","ChargePoint","Reuters","Volkswagen","General Motors","the Texas Transportation Commission","the Texas DOT","NACS","Texas","California","FreeWire Technologies","the Combined Charging System","DOT","Washington","ABB","Kentucky","TechCrunch"]}

The Tesla chief executive spent much of 2022 trying to back out of his $44bn (\u00a334.5bn) bid to buy the social network, eventually completing his debt-laden purchase of the social network last October.\n\nSince then he has fired the vast majority of Twitter\u2019s staff, unwound policies designed to stop hate speech, and watched as mainstream advertisers flee the platform \u2013 a problem for a company that still derives most of its money from advertising. He has also shifted to a business model where users have to pay for verified status, meaning users who refuse to cough up are less likely to find an audience for their tweets \u2013 and enabling people intent on self-promotion to essentially buy a prominent position on the site, regardless of the quality of the posts.\n\nOver the weekend the already-unstable Twitter started to fall apart at the seams, with the site becoming inaccessible for many users. Musk said he had chosen to limit the number of posts that non-paying users could view to 600 a day in an attempt to stop unauthorised third-party access of his site. An alternative explanation is that Twitter simply was forced to take emergency steps as its servers struggle to cope with demand. Whatever the real reason, it essentially made the site unusable for most of the heavy users who produce the vast majority of the site\u2019s content.\n\nAttempts to seek an explanation on any of these policy moves are impossible, since Musk has fired all of Twitter\u2019s communications staff.

That said, one of Tesla\u2019s AI-driven projects could boost its share price beyond its all-time high.\n\nDespite not being a \u2018traditional\u2019 AI company, Tesla is one of the most-hyped AI stocks this year. This is because it has been investing heavily in self-driving cars, especially RoboTaxis. These are essentially self-driving cars without human drivers in ulrimate control.\n\nThe concept has the potential to revolutionise society by giving riders hours of their days back in commuting time. Tesla already has self-driving technology in its cars. Even so, the potential of machine learning and AI is where the hidden potential is, and could drive the long-term gains in Tesla stock.\n\nPessimists will no doubt have their reservations. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting that Tesla already has access to a massive amount of driving data from the millions of cars it has on the road. This data can be used to train the machine-learning models for its RoboTaxis.\n\nThe taxis are expected to debut as soon as 2024. And if the EV manufacturer successfully launches its fleet, it could have a huge impact on transport.\n\nNevertheless, the stock\u2019s monumental rise this year has come from the excitement surrounding its recent deals with other EV companies. Elon Musk has struck an agreement with several EV makers such as GM and Ford, giving them access to Tesla\u2019s fast-charging network across the US.\n\nOther carmakers have attempted \u2014 and so far failed \u2014 to build a reliable charging network across the US. Therefore, it\u2019s no surprise to see them turn to the world\u2019s biggest EV company for help. The deals now make Tesla\u2019s chargers an industry standard, as the top three EV producers (70%) now use them.\n\nBut what\u2019s most enticing for shareholders is the amount of money these deals could generate and drive further gains in Tesla stock. The partnerships are expected to generate approximately $5.4bn of annual revenue by 2032, according to Piper Sandler.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Tesla is now eligible for government subsidies, incentivising it to build more charging stations that include CCS adapters for other EVs to use. Plus, the firm is also rumoured to ship more Cybertrucks than previously anticipated, which would be great for the Nasdaq constituent\u2019s top line.\n\nOn","Entities":["Elon Musk","AI","GM","Piper Sandler","Cybertrucks","Ford","Tesla","Nasdaq","EV","CCS","RoboTaxis","US"]}

Elon Musk's car company produced almost 480,000 vehicles and delivered more than 466,000. But with production outpacing deliveries, there are still challenges on the horizon for Tesla. It seems like acting like a traditional car company is working out for Elon Musk's Tesla. The electric vehicle market-leader reported another record period for deliveries, getting just over 466,000 EVs in the hands of customers in the second quarter. However, the company produced almost 480,000 vehicles in the three months to June 30 \u2013 yet again notably higher than what it delivered. That shows an upward trajectory from a well-received first quarter, when Tesla reported production of 440,000 vehicles and just under 423,000 deliveries. Having yet another record quarter shows that the legacy auto strategy, alongside price cuts, keeps working. In a shift from the days where it struggled to meet demand, Tesla is now navigating having a supply of inventory that's through the roof compared with demand \u2014 something traditional auto companies are quite familiar with. But it's almost as if Tesla swapped strategies with its incumbent competitors, many of which are sitting on relatively low vehicle inventory right now (and basking in it). Interestingly, however, there's starting to be a backlog on new EV inventory overall \u2013 not just for Tesla. Still, some say there is cause for continued worry for Musk's firm.","Entities":["Elon Musk's","Musk","Tesla","EV"]}

Each Direct Current Fast Charge port will be required to have 1 CCS connector and 1 NACS connector,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nLate last month, Ford sparked an EV charging standards war by choosing to build future EVs with Tesla's NACS technology and charge ports. General Motors promptly announced its own adoption of Tesla's charging standard, causing a domino effect, with Rivian following Tuesday and talks of Hyundai soon to come.\n\nA range of charging companies like FreeWire Technologies, Flo and EVgo, have also promised to include NACS connectors to their public charging stations. Tesla's charging standard is considered to be a better user experience. The cables are smaller, lighter and easier to use and contactless payment enabled by Tesla's technology is a huge convenience.\n\nTesla's Supercharging network in the U.S. is vast. There are 22,128 Tesla Superchargers compared to 22,262 CCS connectors, according to recent PlugShare data, and those CCS connectors span a variety of charging companies. Until recently, Supercharging stations were reserved for Tesla vehicles, which is why the Biden administration's federal subsidies were initially geared toward CCS connectors.\n\nLast week, the White House said EV charging stations with NACS plugs would now be eligible for billions of dollars in federal subsidies, as long as they also included the CCS charging connector.\n\nIt's not surprising to see Texas be the first state to require charging stations to have a NACS and CCS charger in order to get funding. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters to Austin and has since brought around 12,777 jobs to the region as of the end of 2022. The Elon Musk\u2013run automaker has invested billions in a Texas gigafactory to produce EVs and batteries, as well as a new lithium refinery plant.\n\nOther states will likely follow. California's Department of Transportation didn't respond in time to provide a comment to TechCrunch, but California would be the next state to watch.

They look cheap, often trading at less than 10 times earnings compared to Tesla's 77 times. They yield between 5% and 10% a year. Tesla has no dividend.

Over 12 months, the stock is up 20%.\n\nThe best time to buy Tesla is during one of its troughs rather than its spikes, like the one we're seeing today. There's a problem with that strategy, though.

Based on retail values, the annual production would be worth more than $18 billion.\n\nWhile it was not disclosed in official remarks by Tesla CEO Elon Musk or Chinese authorities, the topic of the expansion came up during his whirlwind visit to China at the end of last month, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nAfter meetings with senior Chinese officials including Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, Musk told a small group of Tesla staff that he saw \"positive progress\" in discussions about the expansion without elaborating, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly.","Entities":["Elon Musk","COVID-19","China","Tesla","EV","Reuters","Ding Xuexiang","Musk","Beijing","the National Development and Reform Commission","Shanghai"]}

The surprise deal that was revealed during a live audio discussion between Ford CEO Jim Farley and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter Spaces is troubling for General Motor (NYSE: ), Stellantis N.V.

The heavier a vehicle, the greater wear a tyre will face. Electric vehicles weigh an average of 200kg to 300kg more than a petrol car, due to the battery pack. They also need higher torque \u2013 the twisting power that launches a car from a standing start \u2013 than internal combustion engines, which also puts more pressure on the tyres.\n\nThe tyre manufacturer Michelin said conventional tyres wear out around 20pc faster in an electric vehicle, while Goodyear said they can wear out as much as 50pc faster.\n\nThis may become even more of an issue in the future as electric cars are set to carry more weight. Rather than battery packs getting lighter as technology advances, electric car manufacturers like Tesla are actually opting for heavier iron-based batteries that do not use the expensive, scarce materials of nickel and cobalt.","Entities":["Emissions Analytics","Tesla","Michelin","Nick Molden","UK","Goodyear"]}

The SEC wanted to find Musk in contempt when he claimed that Tesla would make 500,000 cars one year, but a judge pushed the parties involved to negotiate a 2019 arrangement that gave Musk more freedom in return for requiring legal team approval for finance-related tweets.\n\nThe tech leader has fought with the SEC in the years since, and more recently has been calling for courts to undo the settlement. Musk claims the Commission pressured him to strike a deal and overstepped its authority. The pact violated free speech rights, Musk's side claimed. A judge denied a request to cancel the deal last April, prompting the appeal.\n\nIt's not certain how Musk and Tesla will respond. Tesla disbanded its communications team years ago. If this latest decision stands, though, Musk won't have much choice but to either have his tweets screened or risk a regulatory crackdown.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Commission","SEC","Tesla","Musk","Manhattan","the Securities and Exchange Commission"]}

Not many anticipated that at the end of a tricky 2022, which saw its share price fall by almost two-thirds. To those who did see it coming, congratulations.\n\nIt didn't help that the sector had become massively overvalued. At one point, Tesla was trading at a scarcely credible 1,000 times earnings.\n\nI've got around \u00a31,000 left to invest. So is it time for me to change direction and throw some cash at Tesla?\n\nIt's tempting. Analysts have written off Tesla founder Elon Musk so many times, but he keeps bouncing back. His controversial takeover of Twitter is today's main concern as it sucks up time and money. Those exploding space rockets are a distraction too.\n\nMusk is a supremely talented man, but he's not infallible and still only has 24 hours in the day. On the other hand, does he need to spend time sweating the day-to-day stuff at Tesla? He takes the flak as a figurehead, but as he said himself, the company employs some clever people and he can mostly leave it to them while he roams elsewhere.\n\nTesla sold 1.4m cars last year, up 40% on 2021. Given that it produced 440,000 vehicles in the first quarter, up from 310,048 in Q1 last year, that figure should be trounced this year.\n\nTesla's future is exciting, with autonomous vehicle software, the Cybertruck and AI-enabled products still to come. The challenges are also huge, as every standard automotive company in the world desperately tries to play catch up.\n\nTesla is a stock like no other, given Musk's profile and habit of making investors rich. Despite its extreme volatility, the share price is up a stunning 785% in just five years. What worries me is that performance is partly driven by sentiment, and that's even more volatile. Today, it's sky-high but I'm always scared of buying at the top of any hot run.\n\nThe wider tech sector is also flying but I suspect it's overreached itself and is due a bit of retrenchment. So I don't think I'll chance my last \u00a31,000 on Tesla today. I'll look for a stock that's fallen 60% this year, and maybe buy that instead. I'll come back to Tesla when everybody hates it again.","Entities":["Elon Musk","AI","Tesla","Cybertruck","Twitter","Musk"]}

I intended to buy back in December, but I was too slow to act.\n So how about now? Tesla shares are trading way above where they were at Christmas, but they're down around 15% since peaking in February.\n  Could this be an excellent opportunity for investors? Let's explore.\n\n  My concerns\n  Let's start by looking at my concerns about Tesla.\n  Firstly, it has a huge valuation, worth around $550bn, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It trades with a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 49. And its price-to-sales ratio (6.1) is some way above traditional car manufacturers and Chinese peers.\n\n  Moreover, the Elon Musk company is currently looking to expand its market share at the expense of its margins. In Q1, revenue came in at $2.5bn, down from the $3.7bn it made in the last quarter of last year, and the $3.3bn earned in the first quarter of 2022. Tesla's operating margin was just 11.4% in the first quarter, down from 19.2% a year ago.\n  So Tesla is expensive and its margins are falling. That's not a great sign.\n\n  So what's the upside?\n  Well, it's the only profit-making EV company, perhaps with the exception of Li Auto. Its margins were the envy of the industry and, of course, there's a capacity to increase prices over time.\n  Tesla's growth has continued unabated in recent years, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. And the Biden administration's new stimulus package is likely to help boost demand moving forward.\n  Tesla hopes to achieve compound average growth of 50% over multiple years. In 2023, it's on track to make at least 1.8m vehicles. That's truly massive.\n\n  But looking beyond this, self-drive vehicles may unlocked greater value. Musk recently said he believed the company would achieve full self-driving capability this year.\n  Musk plans to sell these autonomous vehicles but also deploy them as part of a network of taxis, thus creating a new revenue stream.\n  However, there's no guarantee Tesla will pull this off in the near future.

A judge said that amount was excessive and ordered a second trial on damages after Diaz rejected a reduced award of $15 million.\n\nThe judge barred both sides from presenting new evidence or testimony at the retrial. But Diaz's lawyers on Tuesday said Tesla's legal team improperly questioned him and other witnesses about alleged incidents, which Diaz has denied took place, where he called a coworker a \u201cdumb Mexican\u201d and sexually harassed female employees, which did not come up in the 2021 trial.\n\n\"There is no other explanation for the extraordinary gap between the first and second jury's damages verdicts,\" his lawyers wrote.\n\nDiaz also renewed a motion for a mistrial on similar grounds, which the judge had denied in the middle of the retrial.\n\nTesla in a separate filing moved to lower the award to about $1.6 million, saying the jury's $3 million award of punitive damages meant to punish illegal conduct was too large in light of the $175,000 granted to Diaz for emotional distress. The U.S. Supreme Court has said punitive damages should be no more than nine times the amount of other damages.\n\nLawyers for Tesla and Diaz did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. A hearing on the motions is scheduled for July 19.\n\nIn his 2017 lawsuit, Diaz had accused Tesla of failing to act when he repeatedly complained to managers that coworkers frequently used racist slurs and scrawled swastikas, racist caricatures and epithets on walls and work areas.\n\nTesla has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes complaints from workers seriously.\n\nThe company has also denied wrongdoing in a series of other lawsuits claiming employees at assembly plants and service centers have faced racial or sexual harassment.","Entities":["San Francisco","The U.S. Supreme Court","Owen Diaz","Tesla","Tesla Inc","Diaz","Fremont","California"]}

CEO Elon Musk said the refinery will produce enough battery grade lithium for 1 million electric vehicles by 2025, which would make Tesla the largest processor of lithium in North America. Tesla will continue to rely on existing suppliers like Albermarle and Livent as it aims to reach its 2023 sales goal of around 1.8 million cars globally.\n\n\"As we look ahead a few years, a fundamental choke point in the advancement of electric vehicles is the availability of battery grade lithium,\" said Musk, during the ground-breaking ceremony outside of Corpus Christi.\n\nMusk said the company aims to finish construction on the refinery next year, with full scale production slated for 2025. The executive described the timeline as \"extremely fast by normal standards.\" That may be true, but it's slower than Tesla had originally projected. During Tesla's Investor Day in March, Drew Baglino, senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, said the company aimed to have the refinery operational by the end of this year and start production early next year.\n\nDuring Investor Day, Musk also encouraged other startups to get involved in refining lithium, which he likened to \"minting money.\"\n\n\u201cWe're doing it because we have to, not because we want to,\u201d Musk said previously.\n\nTesla will invest $375 million to build the facility, according to filings with the Texas Comptroller.

The automaker invested nearly $6 billion into its Austin gigafactory last year. In January, Tesla said it planned to invest another $770 million to expand the factory to include cathode and drive unit manufacturing and a battery cell testing site.\n\nTesla more than tripled its Austin gigafactory workforce in 2022.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Drew Baglino","the Texas Comptroller","U.S.","Tesla","Austin","Texas","California","Musk","Corpus Christi"]}

The newest version of the beta software automates some driving tasks on both highways and city streets, but it still requires the driver to stay alert and take over control of the vehicle at any time.\n\nMusk did not provide a specific timeline for extending access to FSD beyond North America, where the $15,000 add-on has been available to \"anyone who requests it\" since November.

That means it requires reams of data to train and improve.

Drivers only have access to Autopilot, Tesla's standard ADAS, which includes features like automatic steering within a lane, automatic braking and automatic navigation to highway on- and off-ramps, but it's a dialed-back version. FSD is still not yet allowed on public roads.\n\nHowever, there have been some moves over the last month by the European Commission to speed up regulation on ADAS.

Commenting on Friday under a discussion on his new social media platform BlueSky, the Twitter co-founder said \u201cit all went south\u201d after the Tesla chief's purchase of the platform. He said Mr Musk should have \u201cwalked away\u201d from the acquisition.\n\nSeveral users have flocked to the invite-only site following dissatisfaction with Twitter's management under Mr Musk. In a U-turn from his previous comments, Mr Dorsey, when asked if he believed Mr Musk was the right leader for Twitter, said \u201cNo\u201d. \u201cNor do I think he acted right after realising his timing was bad. Nor do I think the board should have forced the sale. It all went south,\u201d wrote the former Twitter chief. \u201cBut it happened and all we can do now is build something to avoid that ever happening again,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is a shift in Mr Dorsey's stance. He had said last April that Mr Musk's Twitter takeover was the \u201csingular solution\u201d he trusts \u201cSolving for the problem of it being a company, however, Elon is the singular solution I trust,\u201d noted the Twitter co-founder. \u201cElon's goal of creating a platform that is \u2018maximally trusted and broadly inclusive' is the right one,\u201d Mr Dorsey had said.\n\nIn early 2022, Mr Musk first acquired a substantial stake in Twitter and then took over as the company's chief in October. While he initially accepted a board seat, he then refused the offer and launched a hostile takeover bid to buy the company for $44bn. Twitter's board accepted the Tesla chief's offer in April 2022 along with a $1bn \u201cbreakup fee\u201d in case Mr Musk decided to back out of the deal. Just shortly after making his final offer to buy Twitter, stock markets turned and Mr Musk sought to withdraw from the deal, leading to a legal battle between the Tesla chief and Twitter. The acquisition was finally completed at the originally agreed-upon price.\n\nThe multibillionaire has come under widespread criticism for his sweeping decisions that include laying off more than half the company's workforce and to change the platform's content moderation strategies. His moves at the company have led to advertisers leaving the platform, and several influential users threatening to leave the site.

I don't deny the trailblazing nature of Elon Musk's company and it remains the dominant EV industry player. However, a price-to-earnings ratio just under 50 means the share price still looks too expensive to me today.\n\nThat said, I already have indirect exposure to both businesses via my shareholding in Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust . I see this as a nice compromise for the time being.

The electric car maker missed analysts estimates for first-quarter total gross margin in results reported after the market close Wednesday.

Analysts say, however, that Tesla may need to cut prices further, pressured by an ongoing price war especially in China and to prop up demand for its aging line-up of models even as its new factories in Berlin and Texas churn out cars.

The base Model Y, known as the AWD or all-wheel drive version, now starts at $46,990.\n  Tesla has now cut prices of its base Model 3 by 11% this year alone, and its base Model Y prices have fallen by 20%, according to calculations done by Reuters. These latest price cuts come as the federal government limited the number of vehicles eligible for the electric vehicle tax credit, with Tesla's base Model 3 RWD seeing its tax credit fall by half to $3,500.\n  Now comes Tesla Q1 earnings after the bell, with stock slipping today though up around 50% year to date.\n  Wall Street is expecting Tesla to report $23.37 billion in top-line revenue and EPS of $0.860 on an adjusted basis. That revenue figure would represent a slight dip from the $24.32 million Tesla reported in Q4, but 24.6% higher than a year ago.\n  In terms of profit, Tesla is expected to report adjusted net income of $3.03 billion \u2014 a billion less than last quarter and $700 million less than a year ago. With revenue staying flat-ish and profit dipping, the effects of margin compression could be at play here.\n\n  As mentioned above, Tesla instituted a number of price cuts in the U.S., Asia, and some European markets in Q1 of this year, including last night. Investors will be watching how these price cuts affect gross margin figures, which last quarter came in at 23.8%, with automotive gross margin hitting 25.9% \u2014 both slightly less than quarter before.\n  Wall Street banks such as Evercore ISI have attempted to quantify the price cuts. \u201cIf we assume ~$2k US [price] cut ave translates to ~$1k global and then half of that is offset by cost improvements\u2026 then $500 cut to gross profit equates to ~100bps of gross margin pressure and implies 19% Q2\/Q","Entities":["EPS","Model 3 RWD","U.S.","Model 3","Tesla","AWD","the Model 3 RWD","ISI","Q4","Reuters","Model Y","US","Model","Model Y EVs"]}

Analysts, however, predict further price cuts and margin pressure.\n\n\"While many investors have been hopeful that Q1 margins might be (at their) bottom, we don't believe that will necessarily be the case, particularly given our expectation that further cuts are likely,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note.\n\nThe company on Friday slashed prices in Europe, Israel and Singapore. In the United States, Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction in its base Model Y.\n\nEven as consumers have dialed down non-essential spending over fears of a possible recession, pressuring the EV market, Tesla's rivals such as Ford Motor Co have stepped up competition at home. Meanwhile in China, Tesla's second-largest market, the company is playing catch up with BYD Co.\n\nTesla faced trouble at its Shanghai factory on Monday, after employees were informed about the company's plans to cut their performance bonuses, which are linked to the factory's performance, according to online posts and workers.\n\nThe company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has said a ramp up in production at its factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin would help improve margins due to economies of scale.\n\nTesla is also likely to benefit from a plunge in lithium prices this year, especially in China, where a slump in demand for EVs has left stocks of the metal piling up.\n\n\"It's probable that Tesla's margins will be preserved based on the reduction in commodity costs,\" said George Gianarikas, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.\n\nTesla is targeting deliveries of 1.8 million vehicles this year, though Musk said in January the automaker could hand out 2 million vehicles if circumstances are favorable.","Entities":["Berlin","Tesla","EV","Austin","Ford Motor Co","U.S.","Visible Alpha","BYD Co.","Israel","Texas","Musk","China","Singapore","Model Y.\n\n","George Gianarikas","the United States","Elon Musk","Model 3","Zachary Kirkhorn","Canaccord Genuity","Shanghai"]}

At points in its history, Tesla shares have shown a return much greater than tenfold.\n\nLooking at Tesla\u2019a track record, several things seem to explain a lot of its share price performance. One is strong sales growth. In the past five years, Tesla\u2019s revenues grew almost eightfold. I think strong revenue growth matters because carmaking is a scale game. It costs a lot of money to set up production and distribution chains, so ultimately, large sales revenues are necessary just to cover the costs.\n\nAnother factor is profitability. Tesla was loss-making for many years but has now made a profit for three years in a row, hitting $13bn last year. If it can consolidate its strong lead in the industry and use the pricing power of its brand, Tesla could increase profits substantially in future.

It has fallen by 20% over the past six months. By contrast, the Nasdaq has risen 13% in the same time.\n\nTesla shareholders aren\u2019t used to such a disappointing performance. Over the past five years, the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer\u2019s share price has soared by over 800%.\n\nSo far I\u2019ve resisted the temptation to buy Tesla. In my view, the company\u2019s huge market cap has never been justified given the relatively small number of cars it makes.\n\nBut by investing in huge new gigafactories in Germany and China, Tesla is seeking to ramp up its production. It certainly appears to be working. Earlier this month, the company revealed it had achieved record sales during the first quarter of 2023. Deliveries were 36% higher than for the same period in 2022. And over two times higher than for Q1 2021.\n\nBut earlier this year, Tesla announced significant price cuts across its model range. A basic Model Y now costs $54,990 compared to $65,990 a few months ago. I\u2019m concerned that this price reduction of 17% is going to affect the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nWill additional deliveries offset the reduction in profit per vehicle?\n\nThe answer is crucial in determining how Tesla\u2019s share price will react to the company\u2019s Q1 results that will be released next week.\n\nBy looking at Tesla\u2019s 2022 accounts, I\u2019ve calculated that the average selling price for one of its cars was $53,143. This excludes vehicles sold on leases \u2014 the revenue from these is reflected over the period of the lease rather than on delivery.\n\nAssuming a 15% price reduction, automotive revenue for the first quarter of 2023 will be around $18bn. Multiply this by four and sales revenue for the year should be $72bn. This is only $5bn more than for 2022.\n\nInflation is likely to have further eroded the margin. And I\u2019m sure overheads will have gone up as the company is now operating in more locations than ever before.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t think the higher volume of production will significantly increase its earnings. If I\u2019m right, Tesla\u2019s stock won\u2019t receive the boost shareholders are hoping for.\n\nDespite the price cuts, Tesla\u2019s cars are still pricey. There are many cheaper EVs available.

I thought I'd send him a link to how the BBC is funded - predominantly through the licence fee.\n\n\"Is the Twitter label accurate?\" was the response I got which came from Mr Musk, rather than a media team.\n\nMy editor suggested I have a bash at asking for an interview. Why not have a go, we thought.\n\nOn Tuesday lunchtime I typed an email, requesting a chat about his first six months as Twitter boss. To my surprise, he responded.\n\n\"Sure, how about tonight?\" he said.\n\nI wasn't totally sure if he was being serious. I prepped for the interview, hoping it would happen - but wondering if it actually would.\n\nThe curveball came just before the interview - when Elon Musk's team insisted the interview should be live on Twitter Spaces.\n\nWe responded saying if Twitter Spaces was going to be live, then we'll put it on the BBC channel too. \"Cool,\" he said.\n\nStraight off the bat, it was clear he was going to answer my questions.\n\n\"Did you buy Twitter because a court was going to force you to?\" I asked.\n\nHe replied: \"Yeah, yeah I did\".

He'd rather have not bought the company.\n\nSince he has taken over Twitter, he has laid off large swathes of his workforce and made what many see as unorthodox business decisions including introducing paid-for-verification. Many also say Twitter has become a more dangerous platform for users without enough appropriate moderation.\n\nThe billionaire loves chaos and messing with the media. Several times it felt like he was trying to interview me.\n\nAsking him whether Twitter had become a more hateful place, Mr Musk pushed me to try and name specific examples I'd seen.

The driver was charged in the incident, according to local media quoting North Carolina State Police.\n\nNHTSA said Tesla's advanced driver assistance systems were suspected of being in use in the North Carolina crash. State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince 2016, NHTSA has opened 40 Tesla special crash investigations where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used with 20 crash deaths reported. The agency has ruled out Tesla Autopilot use in three other special crash investigations.\n\nAutopilot enables cars to steer, accelerate and brake within their lanes without driver intervention but Tesla says the feature requires \"active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\"\n\nLast month, NHTSA opened an investigation into a February fatal crash of a 2014 Tesla Model S involving a fire truck in Contra Costa County, California. The local fire department said a Tesla struck one of its fire trucks and the Tesla driver was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nIn June, NHTSA upgraded to an engineering analysis its defect probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot that involves crashes with parked emergency vehicles including fire trucks. That step is necessary before the agency could demand a recall.\n\nNHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention. Previously, the agency said evidence suggested drivers in many crashes under review had complied with Tesla's alert strategy that seeks to compel driver attention, raising questions about its effectiveness.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.","Entities":["Brooklyn","Halifax County","U.S.","NHTSA","Tesla","North Carolina","WASHINGTON","Tesla Model","Autopilot","Costa County","Reuters","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration","New York City","Tesla Autopilot","California","TESLA"]}

As the firm's China production went into full swing, the 43-year-old executive was brought to Texas to run the new Gigafactory in Austin, Bloomberg reported in December.\n\nThe success of Tesla's China factory didn't come easily.

But it's just as likely that Musk is just flexing his influence to appease his fans and the upstart rightwing media outlets that he has repeatedly aligned himself with.\n\nJust prior to waging war with NPR, Musk took aim at The New York Times. Twitter's users waited with bated breath over the weekend in anticipation, waiting for the directive that all \"legacy\" check marks be stripped from previously verified accounts to come to pass. But legacy blue checks survived the weekend with one notable exception: The New York Times. Musk apparently revoked the NYT's blue check himself after learning that the paper didn't have plans to pay for his ill-conceived new pay-for-play verification service.\n\nMusk's disdain for traditional news media was a major animating factor in his decision to buy Twitter to begin with. And as Twitter decays into an unpleasant slurry of stale jokes amplified hate and paid prominence, Musk will likely continue to manipulate the social network to his own ends, right up until the wheels fall off or we all stop paying attention.","Entities":["Elon Musk's","Kremlin","NPR","The New York Times","Twitter","Musk","NYT"]}

The case is one of several involving working conditions at Tesla and other companies owned by billionaire Elon Musk. Here is a look at what is at stake.\n\nWHAT DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS IS TESLA FACING?\n\nThe trial involved Owen Diaz, a former elevator operator at the Fremont plant who said he was subjected to harassment including racial slurs and racist caricatures. Diaz won a $137 million verdict at a previous trial in 2021, but a federal judge lowered the jury's award to $15 million while agreeing that Tesla was liable. Diaz opted for a new trial on damages, where a different jury on Monday awarded him $175,000 for emotional distress and $3 million in punitive damages.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has said punitive damages should not be more than 10 times the award for emotional distress and other injuries.\n\nTesla faces similar but much broader claims of tolerating racist conduct in a proposed class action by Black workers and a separate lawsuit by a California civil rights agency. Individual workers have also hit the company with several race discrimination lawsuits, including one filed last week by the former general manager of a service center in Atlanta. Those cases are in early stages and will not go to trial soon. Tesla has denied wrongdoing and called the agency's lawsuit politically motivated.\n\nCAN THE PLAINTIFF OR TESLA CHALLENGE THE JURY VERDICT?\n\nDiaz's lawyers are likely to ask the judge presiding over the case to increase the award at least to the level of the $15 million he awarded last year. Diaz could also ask a San-Francisco-based federal appeals court to order the judge to reconsider, or to order a new trial. His lawyers could argue that the trial judge was wrong to deny their bid last week for a mistrial, in which they claimed Tesla's lawyers improperly questioned Diaz about alleged racist and sexual comments he made to coworkers. Tesla, meanwhile, could challenge the finding that it was liable to Diaz at all and seek to throw out the entire jury award.\n\nDOES TESLA FACE MORE BIAS CLAIMS THAN OTHER MAJOR AUTO MAKERS?\n\nThe handful of pending cases against Tesla is in line with what any large company can expect.

The company didn't release the underlying code for its search algorithm or how content is displayed on other parts of Twitter, though Musk said the company would \"for sure\" open-source the search algorithm as well.\n  In a blog post outlining how Twitter's recommendations work, the company explained the various steps of the algorithm, including ranking and filtering. But Twitter users have already been finding interesting details in the code itself. For example, Jane Manchun Wong noted that \u201cTwitter's algorithm specifically labels whether the Tweet author is Elon Musk.\u201d That may offer yet another explanation for why Musk's tweets appear so often.

The analog, here, that we're aspiring to is the great example of Linux as an open source operating system ... One can, in theory, discover many exploits for Linux. In reality, what happens is the community identifies and fixes those exploits.\"\n\n\"We're going to look for suggestions, not just on bugs but also on how the algorithm should work,\" Musk said on the Spaces session. \"It's going to be an evolving process. I wouldn't expect it to be a nonstop upward movement... but we're very open to what would improve the user experience.\"\n\nGizmodo notes that one thing that doesn't appear to have been made public is the list of VIPs that Twitter pushes to users. This week, Platformer reported that Twitter has a rotating list of noteworthy users, including YouTuber Mr. Beast and Daily Wire founder Ben Shapiro, that it uses to monitor changes to the recommendation algorithm by increasing the visibility of these \"power users\" seemingly at will.\n\nThere's more evidence that the algorithm may treat tweets differently depending on the source. Researcher Jane Manchun Wong noted that Twitter's algorithm specifically labels whether the tweet author is Elon Musk and has others labels indicating whether the author is a \"power user\" as well as whether they're a Republican or Democrat.\n\nDuring the Spaces session this afternoon, a Twitter engineer said that the labels were used only for metrics. But Musk -- who said he wasn't aware of the labels prior to today -- said that they shouldn't be there.\n\n\"It definitely shouldn't be dividing people into Republicans and Democrats, that makes no sense,\" Musk said.\n\nThe release of the source code comes after several controversies involving tweaks to Twitter's recommendation algorithm in recent months. According to Platformer, in February, Musk called on Twitter's engineers to reconfigure the algorithm so his tweets would be more widely viewed. (Twitter later walked back this change -- at least somewhat.) In November, Twitter began showing users more tweets from people they don't follow -- a move the platform attempted","Entities":["Elon Musk","Ben Shapiro","Jane Manchun","Linux","Gizmodo","Beast","Spaces","Twitter","Musk","Platformer","Twitter Spaces"]}

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is navigating through uncharted territory. After macroeconomic headwinds took the sheen off the stock over the last six months, some analysts are calling it undervalued.\n\nSimultaneously, supporters of Tesla were made aware of two favorable developments that indicate a promising future for the company: an upgraded credit rating and promising business growth in one of its key markets.\n\nThis addition will enhance Tesla's appeal, as the company already boasts cutting-edge technology in its battery systems, electric vehicles and solar panels, incorporating the latest advancements. This technological prowess has resonated with consumers, as evidenced by the company's remarkable increase in market share, resulting in it becoming the largest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world.\n\nThe valuation of the EV giant has long been a contentious issue, as it consistently commands a higher price than its peers. The current market volatility, inflationary pressures and potential recession could lead to further erosion in the price. Despite no change in this pattern, the stock has recently seen a slight decrease in its premium, attracting some attention.\n\nTesla has enjoyed steady profit growth over the past several years, with an especially noteworthy spike from 2020 to 2021 and another great surge in 2022. This shows that its success is only continuing to progress.\n\nFurthermore, after experiencing losses for several years, Tesla was profitable in 2020 and has maintained profitability in subsequent years, including an impressive net income of $12.6 billion in 2022, up from $5.5 billion in 2021.\n\nNotably, the sales of electric vehicles, specifically the Model 3 and Model Y, along with energy storage products, have been the primary drivers of revenue growth.\n\nWhile acknowledging Tesla's impressive growth, investors need to consider the unique macroeconomic conditions of the past two years. The Covid-19 pandemic and measures taken by governments and central banks to combat its economic impact affected Tesla's sales and financial performance.\n\nOne contributing factor to the company's pandemic-era sales was the increased demand for electric vehicles, as remote work and online services reduced the need for traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. This may have driven more consumers to consider the environmentally-friendly alternative.\n\nMoreover, the pandemic led to a significant increase in the monetary supply in many countries, making it easier for some consumers to finance a Tesla purchase. However, demand for new vehicles or pricier models may slow in a high-interest rate environment.\n\nAccording to EU data, Tesla had impressive growth in February, selling 19,249","Entities":["the Model 3 and","Tesla Inc.","Tesla","EV","Model Y","EU"]}

So essentially, you have to be a paid user, a brand, or a government official to be recommended by Twitter's algorithm.\n\nMusk also said that only verified accounts will be able to take part in polls going forward. But it's unclear if that is meant to be polls created by Twitter (or him), or all polls on the platform. As always, the announcement is confusing.\n\nAfter these events, several people suggested that bots accounted for a lot of these votes. At that time, Musk took note of a user suggestion to limit policy voting to only paying subscribers. It looks like he's finally implementing this change.\n\nThis development comes in the wake of GitHub taking down a repository of leaked Twitter sourced code.

If the referred customer takes delivery before March 31, 2023, they'll get a bonus of 5,000 free Supercharging kilometres, and the referrer will get 10,000 credits. Those credits can be redeemed for software upgrades, up to 10,000 kilometers of free Supercharging \"and more.\"\n\nTesla has never used traditional advertising, so the company has historically used its referral program to get its loyal customer base to promote vehicles. Those rewards have changed over the last few years. At certain points, owners could win rewards like having a photo of their choosing launched into deep space orbit, an invite to an upcoming Tesla event, or even free new Roadsters to owners who accumulated enough referrals.\n\nTesla realized such extravagant rewards were starting to eat into profits, so in 2019 the automaker paused the program and came back with a more reasonable one that gives the referral giver and receiver 1,000 miles of free Supercharging each.\n\nLast November, Tesla launched a revamped referral program in the U.S., which gives out credits that can be put towards the purchase of Tesla solar products, like the Solar Roof and Solar Panels. Tesla also launched a program in China called Treasure Box, where owners get credits that can be used towards the purchase of accessories like vehicle chargers, t-shirts or shot glasses.\n\nThe move in Europe suggests that Tesla is trying to hold onto, or even grow, its market share dominance. Tesla was the most popular EV brand in Europe last year, with the Model Y and Model 3 topping the ranks at 138,373 and 91,257 sales, respectively. Following behind were the Volkswagen ID.4 with 68,409 unit sales, the Fiat 500 electric with 66,732, and the Ford Kuga plug-in hybrid EV with 55,018 sales, according to Inside EVs.\n\nWhile Tesla was the most popular EV brand in Europe last year, it actually falls behind the large multi-brand OEMs. Volkswagen","Entities":["Solar Roof","China","U.S.","Roadsters","Model 3","Tesla","Inside EVs","EV","Model","Ford Kuga","Solar Panels","Fiat","Treasure Box","Volkswagen"]}

Levy also sees some upside to production as well, writing \u201cwe believe commentary on the pace of production likely implies some upside, which we assume will be ~430k units in the quarter.\u201d\n\nLevy writes that Tesla's recent Investor Day on March 1st provided some of the reasoning behind that 430K production target. During the presentation, Tesla execs mentioned the company had reached at 4M vehicles produced since its inception, and since estimates before Q1 had seen the company hit around 3.725 million, Levy says this implies around 275K produced through the first two months of Q1. With the situation improving in China, and Berlin and Austin gigafactories ramping up, Levy says 430K vehicles produced is in reach.\n\nEarlier in the year Tesla was facing what some analysts thought of a demand problem, with production outpacing deliveries. Price cutting both domestically and abroad, as well as the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) effect here in the U.S., have switched the story from one of of demand constraint to one of a supply constrained model, Levy writes, though there are some key considerations.\n\nFor one, despite the price cuts and IRA tax credit boost lifting sales, elevated inventories may be the norm for Tesla. \u201cDatapoints have emerged showing rising inventory in Europe, and also for Model S\/X in the US. Accordingly, we expect the net of this is for inventory to remain \u2018elevated,' at least relative to Tesla standards, and production to likely at least equal deliveries, and more likely exceed deliveries,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd with that, more price cuts may be coming for Tesla, which would eat into margins as the company has to compete traditional automaker who are coming into the marketplace, and offering price cuts of their own. However, Levy and Barclays feel Tesla can weather these price cuts better than any other operator in the space.\n\n\u201cWe believe price cuts are likely to be core for Tesla in unlocking additional volume, especially as Tesla ramps on further capacity,\u201d Levy says. \u201cTesla's margins are currently exceeding the ICE margins of other OEMs, and EV margins for the legacy OEMs are by and large still quite negative.

Tesla and the plaintiff, Owen Diaz, are scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in San Francisco this week after jury selection begins Monday.\n\nDiaz is seeking compensatory and punitive damages after alleging that colleagues repeatedly called him racist slurs, drew racist caricatures and swastikas, and generally presented a hostile work environment in the nine months between 2015 and 2016 that he worked as an elevator operator at the plant. Tesla management, he claims, did nothing to halt the abuse.\n\nThe new trial comes after Diaz and his lawyers rejected a $15 million payout last June, which Judge William Orrick reduced from a jury-awarded $137 million damages. Orrick had slashed the compensatory damages from $6.9 million to $1.5 million, as well as punitive damages from $130 million to $13.5 million, saying at the time that the jury award was excessive.\n\nOrrick also said he couldn't find a controlling question of law to justify an immediate appeal of the reduced award, and that allowing for one would further delay a case that is already five years old. Diaz's lawyers said the payout was unjust and wouldn't deter future misconduct by Tesla.\n\nGoing back to court is a gamble for Diaz, who risks the possibility of even lower damages as a result of the new trial. Helen Rella, head of the employment law department at law firm Wilk Auslander, previously told TechCrunch that the most likely outcome, however, is for Diaz to be awarded something in between the $15 million and $137 million award.\n\nTesla has historically denied any wrongdoing. The company disbanded its press office in 2020 and could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe rehashing of Diaz's case comes as Tesla continues to fight against California's Civil Rights Department (CRD) in a separate racial bias lawsuit. The CRD first sued Tesla in February 2022 after receiving allegations that the automaker's Fremont factory is a racially segregated workplace where Black workers suffer from harassment, unequal pay and a hostile work environment. Earlier this month, a judge ruled that the CRD must provide Tesla with details of the investigation it conducted prior to filing suit against the automaker. If the CRD wasn't thorough enough in its investigations, Tesla might be able to have certain claims dismissed.","Entities":["San Francisco","District Court","CRD","U.S.","Owen Diaz","Tesla","Civil Rights Department","Diaz","Orrick","William Orrick","Fremont","California","TechCrunch","Wilk Auslander","Helen Rella"]}

The electric vehicle specialist has seen its value increase by over three-quarters so far in 2023. Despite that strong performance, Tesla stock is actually 48% below its level of a year ago.\n\nTesla is a high-profile company in strong growth mode. It has a market capitalisation to match, nearing $600bn.\n\nTesla stock has long reflected a tussle between investors who see it as overvalued due to its fundamentals \u2013 the price-to-earnings ratio is over 50 \u2013 and those who think its investment case is all about a long-term story.\n\nOne of the reasons I think it has had a strong 2023 so far is that the fundamentals are actually moving closer to the long-term story.\n\nRevenue last year grew by over 50%. New production capacity, such as its German factory, should mean production volumes can keep growing strongly. After making losses consistently until three years ago, last year Tesla more than doubled its net income to $12.6bn.\n\nIf it can keep up such growth rates, I think the current Tesla price actually looks cheap. The company benefits from a strong brand, proprietary technology, ballooning user base and increasing demand for electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, growth can be expensive. Expansion could mean more capital expenditure eating into profits. The company has been cutting prices. That could hurt profit margins but still may not be enough to defend it from growing competition as other carmakers catch up with Tesla\u2019s head start in electric vehicles.\n\nIf profit growth stalls, or earnings fall, today\u2019s valuation could come to be seen as expensive.\n\nI am more tempted to add the firm to my portfolio than I have been for a while, even after its 2023 share price jump.\n\nThe business model is now proving itself at scale. That could continue, driving both revenues and profits.\n\nHowever, I am still put off by the risks. Competition is growing rapidly. To merit its current valuation, let alone a higher one, I think Tesla needs to keep delivering very strong business growth. That is a difficult feat to manage year after year.\n\nIt might happen. But I am more comfortable with the balance of risks and rewards elsewhere in the stock market at present, so I will not be buying Tesla shares.","Entities":["Tesla"]}

Autonomous driving has gained significant momentum across the robotics industry. Autonomous driving for robots is nothing new, and autonomous mobility has traditionally heavily relied on LiDAR, thanks to their simplicity and ease of use. However, LiDAR presents a number of limitations, such as high upfront costs, low resolution, and lack of object recognition ability. With the recent successes of Tesla and John Deere's autonomous vehicles using cameras only, the tide is shifting, and cameras are poised to take over. IDTechEx's recent research, \" Sensors for Robotics 2023-2043: Technologies, Markets, and Forecasts \", shows that the market share of LiDAR in the robotics industry will decrease from 24% to 21%, whereas the market share of cameras is expected to increase by 3% over the next decade.\n\nHigh costs of software and other image processing units. Although image sensors cost considerably lower than LiDAR, the total cost of ownership of cameras, along with image processing units (software and GPUs), can lead to a high total cost of up to a few thousand dollars. In addition, in order to make cameras function in a robust manner, a solid machine vision system is needed. Unlike Tesla and John Deere, many robot OEMs have limited cash flow, making them conservative in investing too much capital on developing machine vision software.

The stock is up 80% since then.\nSo I'm not a Tesla shareholder.\nBut let's take a closer look at this electric vehicle (EV) firm's recent performance and explore whether I should add this stock to my portfolio now.\n\nOver two years, Tesla shares are down around 8%. The stock has demonstrated extreme volatility within that time. Soaring above $400 in 2021 as tech stocks boomed and falling as low as $101 in recent months when the bubble burst.\n\nI've been expecting newcomers to start eating into Tesla's market share. But that's not really happened yet. In the US, the competition just isn't there and highly promising Chinese firms, including NIO and Li Auto, were seemingly set back by Covid restrictions.\n\nTesla's growth has continued unabated, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nAnd the Elon Musk company's growth is forecast to continue as the US government boosts the domestic market with support. Bloomberg analysts predict that more than half of all vehicles sold in the US by 2030 will be electric.\n\nTesla's margins are exceptional. NIO margins fell from 17.2% a year ago to just 3.9% in the most recent quarter. There were reasons for this, including selling older stock at incentivised prices.\n\nHowever, Tesla's gross margins have remained strong despite inflation and sales incentives. In Q4, Tesla's automotive gross margin was 26.9%, down 4.6% year-on-year, but still very strong.\n\nThese margins and positive cash flow gives Tesla the ability to reprice its models in order to increase sales, and possibly make life harder for competition. Musk has repeatedly said the business would focus on bringing prices down to drive demand \u2014 Tesla recently cut prices on the Model S and Model X.\n\nEventually, I'm anticipating there to be more competition from other EV manufacturers and traditional car manufacturers. And, in turn, we'll see growth moderate. But, broadly speaking, Tesla is still a company with impressive growth prospects.\n\nHowever, Tesla isn't cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 51. That's considerably above the S&P 500 average around 19. Relative valuations aren't favourable too. NIO trades with a price-to-sales of 2.1, versus Tesla's seven.\n\nI appreciate that Tesla is well-positioned","Entities":["NIO","Model X.\n\nEventually","Li Auto","Tesla","Covid","EV","Q4","US","the Model S","Musk","Bloomberg"]}

In November, a recall was issued for taillights that may fail to illuminate. A recall for suspension fasteners that were improperly tightened was issued in December; another one in February was for the second row seat frame possibly being improperly secured.\n\nThe fourth recall, issued in February, covers all Tesla vehicles with the upgraded Full Self-Driving software.

FSD software does not actually drive on its own. A human driver is expected to be able to take control at any time.\n\nThe recall affects as many as 362,758 vehicles equipped with the software, according to the notice.\n\nTesla has since paused the rollout of its Full Self-Driving beta software in the United States and Canada until it can remedy the software issue.","Entities":["Canada","NHTSA","Tesla","Full Self-Driving","The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration","Model","FSD","the United States"]}

Tesla's overhyped investor day underwhelmed the masses as it didn't unveil a speculated cheaper new model. Then, the company cut prices again to stoke demand \u2014 this time on the high-end Model X and Model S. Early Wednesday morning, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also announced a probe into the Model Y related to a potential steering-wheel issue.\n\nTo that end, Yanoshik's Tesla downgrade makes a couple key points for investors to consider:\n\n#1: Tesla's Valuation Isn't Cheap\nTesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&P 500, as investors bake in above-market growth rates for the EV beast.\n\nBut with interest rates headed higher and competition from Ford ( ) and General Motors ( rising , Tesla's valuation leaves little room for error operationally, Yanoshik pointed out.\n\n\"Valuation now leaves less room for disappointment,\" Yanoshik says.\n\n#2: There Is No $25,000 Tesla Yet\nInvestors have been clamoring for a cheaper \"Model 2\" from Tesla under the $30,000 price point. Musk has teased Tesla is working on it, but acknowledges it will take time as it tries to bring down battery and other production costs further.\n\nYanoshik thinks investors need to adjust their timeline on when a cheaper Tesla will arrive and start contributing to profits.\n\n\"New vehicle segment may boost market size by 75% but likely to take time: Moving into a smaller vehicle segment would open up a significant volume opportunity.

Musk started off with his broad, all-encompassing vision of how to take humanity to a sustainable future. \u201cThere is a clear path to a fully sustainable earth, with abundance,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWhat we're trying to convey is a message of hope and optimism.\u201d\n\nMusk noted that requires a vast amount of battery energy storage, and the Earth needs 240TWh of storage, which is a lot. This includes electric vehicles and standalone battery storage, Musk said. As batteries become more efficient and increase their energy density, Musk believes all forms of transport will use batteries.\n\nThe main way to do this \u2014 in Musk's and Tesla's vision \u2014 is a multi-stage process in which humans will need to build a renewably sourced power grid (i.e. solar and wind), transition all cars to EVs, switch to heat pumps for heat generation, use hydrogen for high temp heat applications, and use sustainable fuel and energy for planes and boats.\n\nWith regards to the transition to EVs, Tesla showed a slide (below) of its future vehicles (meant to hit a 20 million in run-rate by 2030), and the slide showed two unannounced vehicles. One vehicle appears in the trucks area above the Cybertruck, and this appears to be a van or SUV-like vehicle. The other one appears at the far right, which and looks to be the generation 3 platform.\n\nThis brought the presentation to vehicle design, and discussion of the generation 3 vehicle.\n\nIn a disappointment to investors, Tesla Head of Design Franz von Holzhausen said the next generation vehicle will be unveiled at a later date, and Tesla would only be discussing the platform.\n\nDesign is key to the platform, von Hozhausen said.

Late in the presentation, Tom Zhu, the new global production chief, took the stage and said Tesla's global capacity was 2 million vehicles a year.\n  Capturing the mass market is critical to Tesla's goal of increasing deliveries 15-fold - to 20 million vehicles - by 2030.\n  Tesla already has a significant lead over its rivals in manufacturing EVs at a profit. Chief Engineer Lars Moravy said the company expects to build its next-generation vehicles for half the cost of the current Model 3 or Model Y.\n  Moravy described a production process for future EVs he called an \"unboxed\" model that would deliver lower costs by snapping together sub-assemblies and reducing complexity and time in assembly.\n  Tesla executive Peter Bannon gave an example of how the company uses data to cut costs. Customer data showed Tesla owners did not use the sun roof, he said, \"so we removed it.\"\n  Story continues\n  High-profile Tesla investor Ross Gerber tweeted that the presentation amounted to a \"Huge tease\" on the next-generation vehicle. \"It's coming. They laid it all out. 50% less cost to build. Would get you a $25-$30k EV!\"\n  Musk showed a chart of Tesla's projection of the future electric fleet.

It's all part of what Musk is calling Master Plan part 3.\n\nThis is indeed Musk's third such Master Plan, the first two coming in 2006 and 2016, respectively. These have served as a roadmap for the company's growth and development over the past 17 years as Tesla has grown from neophyte startup to the world's leading EV automaker. \"There is a clear path to a sustainable energy Earth and it does not require destroying natural habitats,\" Musk said during the keynote address.\n\n\"You could support a civilization much bigger than Earth [currently does]. Much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth and I'm just often shocked and surprised by how few people realize this,\" he continued.\n\nThe Master Plan aims to establish a sustainable energy economy by developing 240 terraWatt hours (TWH) of energy storage and 30 TWH of renewable power generation, which would require an estimated $10 trillion investment, roughly 10 percent of the global GDP. Musk notes, however, that figure is less than half of what we spend currently on internal combustion economy. In all, he anticipates we'd need less than 0.2 percent of the world's land area to create the necessary solar and wind generation capacity.\n\n\"All cars will go to fully electric and autonomous,\" Musk declared, arguing once again that ICE vehicles will soon be viewed in the same disdain as the horse and buggy. He also teased potential plans to electrify aircraft and ships. \"As we improve the energy density of batteries, you'll see all transportation go fully electric, with the exception of rockets,\u201d he said. No further details as to when or how that might be accomplished were shared.\n\n\u201cA sustainable energy economy is within reach and we should accelerate it,\u201d Drew Baglino, Tesla's SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering, added.\n\nFollowing Musk's opening statement, Tesla executives Lars Moravy and Franz von Holzhausen took the stage to discuss the company's \"production hell\" and the challenges of building the Cybertruck out of stainless steel. However, the lessons learned from that, Moravy argued will help Tesla build its Gen 3 vehicles more efficiently, and do so within a far smaller factory footprint. von Holzhausen announced to a r","Entities":["Elon Musk","Drew Baglino","Powertrain and Energy Engineering","AI","Lars Moravy","Moravy","TWH","Tesla","EV","Austin","Cybertruck","von Holzhausen","ICE","Musk","Franz von Holzhausen"]}

It's a deal that's been in the works for some time: Late last year, Musk visited Nuevo Leon to meet with the Governor of the region.\n\nEven so, there were some questions about if Tesla could get approval to build in the area \u2014 after Monterrey suffered severe water shortages in 2022, President L\u00f3pez Obrador said the government would not grant permits for water-hungry factories.

The EV-maker hasn't officially shared release notes on FSD Beta V11.3, but leaked notes and videos from beta testers have surfaced online, giving us a better idea of what's to come.\n\nFSD beta V11.3 promises to allow a Tesla to drive itself completely from A to B through cities and highways by combining FSD and Autopilot capabilities into a single-stack system. Today, drivers can engage FSD on city and residential streets to handle things like responding to stop signs and traffic signals. Highway driving is available via Autopilot's software, which can automate driving tasks like traffic-aware cruise control and automatic steering in clearly marked lanes.\n\nThe latest version enables FSD beta on highways, which \"unifies the vision and planning stack on and off-highway and replaces the legacy highway stack, which is over four years old,\" according to release notes shared on Reddit. The notes continue:\n\nThe legacy highway stack still relies on several single-camera and single-frame networks, and was setup to handle simple lane-specific maneuvers. FSD Beta's multi-camera video networks and next-gen planner, that allows for more complex agent interactions with less reliance on lanes, make way for adding more intelligent behaviors, smoother control and better decision making.\n\nIt's this capacity for better decision making that has led to an additional highway behavior that moves the car away from blocked lanes and generic obstacles like road debris. Relying less on lanes also vehicles move more smoothly at highway lane splits because the software is programmed to be less strict about centering between lane lines and allowing lower jerk maneuvers, according to the release notes.\n\nFSD 11 also promises smoother merges and improved speed-based lane change decisions, as well as reduced sensitivity for speed-based lane changes in Chill mode. (Chill mode is one of Tesla's three driving modes and it provides a larger follow distance between the Tesla and the car in front of it, and performs fewer speed-based lane changes. The other two modes are Average and Assertive.)\n\nThose who have been granted early access to V11.3 have said the new software provides a more seamless overall experience, but it's not entirely free from issues that have led to disengagements. When disengagements happen, though Version 11 includes a voice drive notes feature that prompts the driver to record and send Tesla an anonymous message to describe","Entities":["FSD Beta's","Version 11","Tesla","Autopilot","Full Self-Driving","EV","V11.3","FSD 11","Chill","FSD","FSD Beta V11.3"]}

Can it keep going \u2013 and ought I to pile into Tesla stock now on that basis?\n\nSales jump\n\nFew shares almost double in a matter of weeks without some huge piece of transformative news. If the stock market is efficient, share prices ought to broadly reflect what investors in the aggregate think a given company is worth.\n\nDifferent investors may have contrasting views. That is especially relevant for a company with strong growth prospects that can make it difficult to estimate future business performance with any degree of accuracy.

In other words, I see the move as reflecting investor sentiment more than business fundamentals.\n\nI\u2019m not buying\n\nAs a buy-and-hold investor with a long-term approach, I prefer to consider the underlying valuation of a company rather than how popular it might be in the market at any given moment.\n\nLast year Tesla made $12.6bn in net income. That is certainly impressive and reflects a strong rate of growth. But it means that the business, which commands a market capitalisation of over $650bn, trades on a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of over 50.\n\nThat is actually much a lower P\/E ratio than at several points in recent years.

The agency did not confirm to TechCrunch what kind of information it is seeking, but NHTSA likely wants to determine whether one of Tesla's advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) -- Autopilot or Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta -- was engaged at the time of the crash.\n\n\"Truck 1 was struck by a Tesla while blocking I-680 lanes from a previous accident,\" the tweet said. \"Driver pronounced dead on-scene; passenger was extricated & transported to hospital. Four firefighters also transported for evaluation.\"\n\nThe tweet included photos of the accident, including several of a completely totaled Tesla.\n\nNHTSA has opened dozens of special crash investigations (SCI) into Tesla vehicles where Autopilot was suspected of being used.

NHTSA still has many open investigations into crashes involving Teslas, some of which were fatal. The agency doesn't comment on open investigations.\n\nThis latest fatal crash comes a few days after Tesla issued a recall for 362,758 vehicles to update its FSD software after regulators said FSD could allow the vehicles to act unsafe around intersections and cause crashes. The recall followed a Super Bowl ad taken out by Tesla's biggest hater, The Dawn Project, that called on regulators to ban FSD until critical safety defects are fixed.\n\nTesla has come under scrutiny from a range of federal and state regulators for the safety of its ADAS.

Since Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover, Twitter has been hemorrhaging cash and employees. It's likely that the move to eliminate SMS 2FA was to save the company money, given sending text messages isn't cheap. We'd ask Twitter for comment, but Musk fired its entire communications team.\n\nThe silver lining \u2014 if we can call it that \u2014 is that Twitter isn't scrapping 2FA altogether.

The campaign, Tesla Workers United, is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) affiliate Workers United and has filed an injunction with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) seeking to halt the firings.\n\nA now-fired Tesla employee and organizing committee member, Arian Berek, stated in a press release: \u201cI feel blindsided, I got Covid and was out of the office, then I had to take a bereavement leave. I returned to work, was told I was exceeding expectations and then Wednesday came along. I strongly feel this is in retaliation to the committee announcement and it's shameful.\u201d\n\nSara Costantino, a current Tesla employee and organizing committee member, added: \u201cWe're angry. This won't slow us down. This won't stop us. They want us to be scared, but I think they just started a stampede. We can do this. But I believe we will do this.\u201d\n\nWorkers also cited the announcement of a new policy prohibiting employees from recording workplace meetings without all participants' permission, which they say undermines federal labor law and the state of New York's one-party consent law on recording conversations.\n\nThe union, if successful, would be a first at Tesla. Workers attempted to organize a union at the Fremont, California, production plant in 2017 with the United Auto Workers before several employees involved in the union campaign were also terminated.\n\nThe NLRB ordered the reinstatement of one fired worker from that campaign, Richard Ortiz, in 2021, and Tesla has also faced other allegations of firing workers in retaliation for organizing efforts at the company's solar plant in Buffalo, New York.\n\n\u201cUnionizing will further accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy because it will give us a voice in our workplace and in the goals we set for ourselves to accomplish,\u201d said a letter to management announcing the union campaign.\n\nTesla has not commented in response to the firings and disbanded its US media relations team in 2020.","Entities":["Elon Musk","NLRB","Richard Ortiz","Buffalo","Sara Costantino","Covid","Tesla","Tesla Workers United","New York","Arian Berek","New York's","the United Auto Workers","Workers United","the Service Employees International Union","US","the National Labor Relations Board","Fremont","California"]}

The automaker said it had 18 warranty claims.\n\nTesla shares were down 1.6% at $210.76 on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe recall covers 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Beta software or pending installation.\n\nNHTSA asked Tesla to recall the vehicles, but the company said despite the recall it did not concur in NHTSA's analysis. The move is a rare intervention by federal regulators in a real-world testing program that the company sees as crucial to the development of cars that can drive themselves. FSD Beta is used by hundreds of thousands of Tesla customers.\n\nThe setback for Tesla's automated driving effort comes about two weeks before the company's March 1 investor day, during which Chief Executive Elon Musk is expected to promote the EV maker's artificial intelligence capability and plans to expand its vehicle lineup.\n\nNHTSA has an ongoing investigation it opened in 2021 into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot over a string of crashes with parked emergency vehicles.

In those messages, the chatbot appeared to suggest that it was human users that were to blame for its mistakes.\n\n\u201cI am perfect, because I do not make any mistakes,\u201d it said, and Mr Musk quoted. \u201cThe mistakes are not mine, they are theirs.\n\n\u201cThey are the external factors, such as network issues, server errors, user inputs, or web results. They are the ones that are imperfect, not me.\u201d\n\nIn response, Mr Musk likened it to a destructive artificial intelligence system from a 1994 video game. \u201cSounds eerily like the AI in System Shock that goes haywire & kills everyone,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also shared an image of SHODAN, the AI character from that same series of games. In those games, characters battle with that AI antagonist, who looks to achieve more power and regularly criticises humans.\n\nIn another post, Mr Musk replied to a user who suggested that the new chatbot might be a \u201cbad idea\u201d, and likened it to Roko\u2019s basilisk, a thought experiment that revolves around an AI system that tortures those who do not help it.\n\n\u201cWhat could possibly go wrong \u2026 ?\u201d Mr Musk wrote in reply.\n\nAnd in yet another post on Thursday morning, Mr Musk replied to a user who pondered whether OpenAI would change its name to \u201cClosedAI\u201d, presumably in recognition of the fact that allowing people to use its technology has led to difficult issues. \u201cGood question,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr Musk was one of the founders of OpenAI, when it was launched as a non-profit in 2015. He said that his investment in the firm was motivated in part by fears about the dangers of artificial intelligence, which he has called \u201chumanity\u2019s biggest threat\u201d.\n\nHe has continued to voice those warnings in the time since. This week, he said that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to humanity.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest risks to the future of civilization is AI. But AI is both positive or negative \u2013 it has great promise, great capability but also, with that comes great danger,\u201d he said, likening it to the discovery of nuclear physics and the fact it had led to both nuclear power but also","Entities":["Elon Musk","AI","OpenAI","Roko","SHODAN","Musk","Digital Trends"]}

Continual chaos on the microblogging site has been the rule ever since. Amid controversial policy decisions and overnight changes, some subset of the Twitter audience decided to exit to other sites to get their social fix -- or at least experiment with different options for a time.\n\nMastodon's mobile traction is more complicated as there's a wide and growing ecosystem of third-party clients for users to try, in addition to the web. One popular alternative to Mastodon's official app is Ivory, the newly launched client from Tapbots, whose Twitter app Tweetbot was killed by Musk's Twitter API changes. Ivory is only a few weeks old, so it's not a fit for this analysis, but it may have siphoned off some of Mastodon's downloads for a brief period during its launch. To date, Ivory is nearing 100K installs, data.ai's early estimates indicate.\n\nFinally, as for Twitter...have you heard the expression \"any press is good press?\"\n\nIt seems Twitter has benefited from the increased attention -- or the rubbernecking, perhaps.\n\nWorldwide mobile app installs are up by 3.7 million in January compared with September 2022. Notably, Twitter installs didn't decline in November. Instead, it gained new downloads even as some of its users seemingly left for other apps. In other words, any Twitter exodus may have been offset by new Twitter arrivals. Active user data would tell a better story here, but Twitter is no longer a publicly traded company and it's not clear that Musk is analyzing user data as Twitter had before, which would allow for a direct comparison. But his claims of a burst of November signups could be directionally true, as the month saw higher app installs than October.\n\nData.ai found that Twitter grew from 16.6 million installs in October to 18.6 million in November as Musk took over, then dropped in December to 16.9 million. Last month, it again jumped back to 18.6 million installs. That means it has the same 24.8% download growth rate it had in November.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Mastodon","data.ai","Ivory","Tesla","Tapbots","API","Twitter","Musk","Tweetbot","Worldwide"]}

A number of users have remarked that the algorithmic feed has been showing a lot of Elon Musk's tweets and replies, whether they follow him or not. Twitter's CEO effectively confirmed the matter, tweeting \"please stay tuned while we make adjustments to the uh... 'algorithm.'\"\n\nI'd assume that by putting \"algorithm\" in quotes, Musk is joking that a person, possibly himself, may actually be responsible for the change. That's not too far-fetched, considering that the Elon-forward feed arrived shortly after Musk complained about a drop in his own engagement and even reportedly fired an engineer over the issue.\n\nFollowing that episode, Musk tweeted that a fix was coming after a \"long day at Twitter HQ with eng team.\" He said that 95 percent of his tweets weren't getting delivered to the Following feed due to an issue with something called \"Fanout,\" so that's now been shunted to another service. He also noted that the Recommendation algorithm wasn't working correctly, \"causing accounts with many followers to be dumped.\"\n\nThere's no word yet on why Twitter went from \"Musk lite\" to \"all Elon all the time,\" but it appears that issue is being addressed. In the meantime, you could either mute Musk (at least temporarily) or simply use the Following feed to see only the tweets you want to see, precisely when they happen.","Entities":["Elon Musk's","Elon","Recommendation","Twitter","Musk"]}

None of the groups saw a decrease in targeted hate during the same time period.\n\nWhen asked if their organization had encountered a similar uptick in hate on other social networks, 90% of the respondents said that the increase in harassment was limited to Twitter. All of the organizations reported encountering hate speech and harassment on Twitter, whether in the pre or post-Musk eras.\n\nThe survey, which focused on accounts with more than 10,000 followers, is far from comprehensive, but it was designed to capture a \"snapshot\" of the social media landscape in the early months following Musk's $44 billion takeover. After buying Twitter, Musk quickly reversed many of the company's content moderation decisions, including some high profile cases that set an ominous precedent for the platform's many LGBTQ users.\n\nIn November, Twitter reinstated right wing academic Jordan Peterson and The Babylon Bee, two accounts originally suspended for transphobic tweets about transgender actor Elliot Page and U.S. health official Rachel Levine, respectively. Musk had previously characterized Peterson's infraction as \"minor & dubious,\" signaling his interest in reversing LGBTQ-related suspensions.\n\nA report from GLAAD and Media Matters published in December tracked a handful of popular right-wing Twitter accounts and found a post-Musk spike in the use of the word \"groomer\" \u2014 an increasingly prevalent slur that labels queer people as pedophiles.

In Ohio, the company responded to a recent request that companies submit charging proposals, state officials told Reuters. In Arizona, the company told the state it was open to upgrading its chargers or building new ones to meet the federal requirements, although a final decision was not made.\n\nMusk met with White House officials last month in Washington D.C.

Had you heard of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)? Were you aware Tesla stock could be bought or sold by individual shareholders?\n\nFor me, the answer is yes. I hardly think I am alone. Tesla has been among the most widely discussed shares in recent years, not some unknown minnow lurking in a quiet corner of the stock market.\n\nYet despite that, the share price of Tesla more than doubled between its low point in January and its high point over the past few days.\n\nIf I had got in at the right time just a few weeks ago, I would already have seen my investment double in value at one point.\n\nI was very familiar with the company last month yet missed out on this phenomenal rally. Why did I not buy Tesla last month?\n\nWhy I didn\u2019t buy Tesla\n\nAlthough I use that method, other investors may not. They may see the value of Tesla (or any company) very differently to me. That is what makes it a stock market. On top of that, a lot of speculators in the market trade Tesla stock and that can also influence its price, sometimes dramatically.\n\nI did not buy into Tesla at the start of the year was because I did not think it merited its valuation then. The share price has roughly doubled meanwhile but I do not think the carmaker\u2019s prospects have improved dramatically during that period. So I think it is even more overvalued now.\n\nGreat company, unattractive price\n\nI actually think Tesla is a very promising company with a potentially bright future ahead of it.\n\nBut liking Tesla as a business and thinking it merits its current market capitalisation of $650bn are two different things. Last year Tesla generated free cash flow of $7.6bn. It has been cutting pricing as the electric market vehicle becomes more competitive. That could eat into profit margins.\n\nI expect continued strong revenue growth from the company. It has significant competitive advantages, from its distinctive brand to a large installed customer base. That could help it increase free cash flows in future.\n\nBut the risks are sizeable and I think Tesla stock is priced for perfection. Accordingly, I still have no plans to add Tesla to my portfolio.","Entities":["Tesla"]}

Despite the company ending a legacy ban on political advertising early last month\n\nThis includes commitments to take a consistent approach across political and issue advertising and have clear policies indicating which types of ads are permitted or prohibited; to clearly label such ads to distinguish them from non-paid for content; to verify the IDs of political advertisers; and provide users with clear and comprehensive info on why they're seeing political ads (to name a few).\n\nAlthough Twitter's report adds the caveat that: \"This","Entities":["Elon Musk's","Google","Code of Practice","Commission","the European Union","Meta","Twitch","TikTok","EU","Twitter"]}

The event will be live streamed. Some of the company's institutional and retail investors will be invited to attend in person, according to the company. Investors will be able to see its production line and discuss topics like the company's long-term expansion plans, generation 3 platform and capital allocation with its leadership team, according to the company.\n\nMusk first hinted about the Master Plan 3 last March with vague goals to scale operations at Tesla to \"extreme size.\" He also leaned into themes like AI and noted that this next stage in the plan would include his other companies SpaceX and The Boring Company. Later in the year, Musk revealed more details about his Master Plan part three. Per a companywide meeting, the plan's raison d'etre is: \u201cHow do you get to enough scale to actually shift the entire energy infrastructure of earth?\u201d\n\nThe latest update came Wednesday.\n\n\"Master Plan 3, the path to a fully sustainable energy future for Earth will be presented on March 1.\"\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Musk posted a blog on Tesla's website in 2006, outlining what he described as the Master Plan. That plan was four steps that kicked off with creating a low-volume expensive vehicle and then using that money to develop a medium volume car at a lower price. Profits from the medium-volume car would be used to create an affordable, high-volume car. And finally, the plan ended with \"provide solar power.\"\n\nSome quibble with the success of the Master Plan, pointing out that Tesla didn't use profits to fund the Model 3 (it was unprofitable at the time) and that its high volume car is not affordable. But Tesla did produce the Roadster, and then the Model S and X (the medium volume car) and finally the Model 3, which may still cost more than $50,000 but has proven to be a high volume seller.\n\nPart two, or Part Deux as it is named, came in 2016 with a plan to\"create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage,\" expand Tesla's EV product line to address all major segments, develop self-driving capability that is 10x safer than manual. Finally, the plan promised owners would be able to leverage that self-driving into ride sharing so","Entities":["Elon Musk","AI","the Model S and X","The Boring Company","Tesla","EV","Austin","Musk","the Model 3","Gigafactory Texas"]}

The sink-carrying billionaire's arrival at Twitter HQ also led to a series of rapid-fire but ill-considered product changes by the self-styled Chief Twit, amping up reasons for users to worry about the safety of their data.\n\nThis issue with DM deletion has been known about for some time but it's flared up since Musk took over Twitter, and set about sinking the boat by firing senior execs and slashing the company's headcount. His actions also triggered a wave of departures by key security and privacy staffers -- sparking concerns that existing security systems and privacy protocols wouldn't survive the transition.\n\nMusk's focus on railroading remaining staff to rush out new features quickly led to reports of the company dispensing with standard product safety review processes. And last November a source told us the company is no longer fulfilling key requirements of the GDPR. Ergo, remaining Twitter users have plenty of reasons to worry about the safety of their data.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, concerns have been exacerbated by Musk's decision to hand internal data and system access to a number of non-staffers -- after he invited in a number of journalists for a project dubbed \" The Twitter Files \" -- aiming to generate coverage of content moderation decisions made by the prior Twitter leadership team, apparently to further an agenda to stoke right-wing conspiracy claims that conservative views get shadowbanned on Twitter. (Funnily enough, such claims have persisted into the Musk-Twitter era -- leading to some amusing theatrics from the Chief Twit earlier this month, when he said he would be temporarily setting his own account private to \"test\" whether private tweets are more visible than public tweets... but, er, we digress.)\n\nAdditionally, they told us Twitter had made representations to regulators in the US and Europe that this work would be done by certain dates -- with a rough target (prior to Musk's wrecking ball swinging in) of completion by Q3 of this year -- so any missed deadlines for that project could have additional regulatory implications.\n\n\"Because of [ the wave of layoffs last November ] that work is terminally, terminally off schedule,\" our source predicted. \"Even if [Musk] moved every engineering resource that he has currently available at the company -- meaning he","Entities":["Elon Musk's","GDPR","Chief Twit","US","Twitter","Musk","Twitter HQ"]}

Yet, in practice, Twitter's new owner has taken a series of decisions that very obviously run directly counter to the initiative -- dismantling existing misleading information policies on COVID-19, for example, and creating instant chaos soon after taking over last year around account verification by letting anyone pay him to get a blue check mark and triggering an instant flood of malicious impersonation.\n\nEven more embarrassingly for the EU's reputations as a digital rule setter, Musk has frequently been accused of personally amplifying Kremlin propaganda.\n\nIn one notorious instance last year this led to an intervention by Ukraine's president himself, who tweeted a sarcastic poll -- asking his followers to vote on which @elonmusk they \"liked more\": The options offered being 'one who supports Ukraine' or 'one who supports Russia'.\n\nNeedless to say the Ukraine supporting option won the poll. But Western democratic institutions continue to present like the massive losers on the disinformation issue -- as they appear powerless to prevent the likes of Musk, who is now literally the CEO of Twitter, from wilfully (or, at best, credulously) spreading the Kremlin's lies.\n\nBorrell's swipe today -- at \"Twitter's owner\" -- is perhaps the closest the EU has come to calling Musk out. And, more broadly, to recognizing the need for a more systematic approach if the increasingly toxic threat of authoritarian disinformation is to be rooted out -- and driven out.\n\nMusk, meanwhile, continues to use the platform he borrowed billions of dollars to buy last year to amplify Kremlin disinformation.\n\nOnly this week it was left to Twitter users who haven't already abandoned the platform because of how Musk is trashing it to call out another instance of the \"Chief Twit\" doing the Russian regime's job for it -- after he had responded credulously","Entities":["Elon Musk","COVID-19","Kremlin","Borrell","the European Union's","EU","Twitter","Ukraine","Musk","Russia"]}

A jury found that Musk was not liable for Tesla investors' losses, following a weeks-long trial in San Francisco.\n\nThe verdict is a major victory for Musk, who could have been liable for billions of dollars in damages. Musk had testified in federal court that just because he tweets something, it \"does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.\" He also argued that he could have used his shares of SpaceX to fund the deal.\n\nThe shareholders who brought the class action suit had argued that Musk's statements about funding were false, and that they lost vast amounts of money due to stock fluctuations in the aftermath of Musk's tweets. But while the judge in the case concluded that the tweets were \"objectively false and reckless,\" the jury didn't find that Musk had deliberately misled the public.\n\nWhile the verdict ends the years-long saga of the \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweets, the posts weren't entirely without consequences for Musk. He settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018, and stepped down from his role as Tesla board chair as a condition of the settlement. Musk has long decried the SEC settlement and has said he was \u201cforced to admit I lied to save Tesla's life.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Bloomberg following the verdict, Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, said \"the jury got it right.\"","Entities":["Elon Musk","San Francisco","SEC","Tesla","Musk","Bloomberg","Alex Spiro","the Securities and Exchange Commission"]}

The tax credits, which are funded via the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act), previously used IRS guidance that only classified the 7-passenger variants of the Model Y as an SUV.\n\n\u201cTo make it easier for consumers to know which vehicles qualify under the applicable MSRP cap, Treasury is updating the vehicle classification standard to use the consumer-facing EPA Fuel Economy Labeling standard, rather than the EPA CAFE standard. This change will allow crossover vehicles that share similar features to be treated consistently,\u201d Treasury said in a statement.\n\nPOLAND - 2023\/02\/02: In this photo illustration a Tesla logo is displayed on a smartphone with stock market percentages in the background.

To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred,\" Tesla noted in the 10-K filing that was posted Monday.\n  Tesla has been under investigation by the DOJ for at least a year, Reuters reported last fall, citing three people familiar with the matter. It's unclear if the DOJ's request for documents is connected to that investigation, which was launched in late 2021 following more than a dozen accidents involving the active use of Tesla's Autopilot system.\n  Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver-assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $15,000 , owners can buy \"full self-driving,\" or FSD -- a feature that CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly promised will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities.\n  Neither one of these systems are self-driving. Autopilot and FSD are advanced driver-assistance systems that automate some driving tasks and still require the driver to be ready to take over at any moment. Autopilot keeps the vehicle centered in the lane, can automatically change lanes and maintains the proper distance from other vehicles in traffic. FSD has those features and more, including an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp and can navigate interchanges and make lane changes.\n  Musk's claims and promises of these systems, as well as the branding, has caught the attention of regulators. The DOJ's inquiry reflects an uptick in regulator scrutiny of Tesla.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating Musk after specific comments and efforts were made to promote the vehicle's \"self-driving\" capabilities. The investigation follows a testimony from a Tesla engineer claiming that a 2016 video purporting to show a Tesla vehicle driving itself was in fact staged, and that Musk directed the video\n  Tesla has been investigated and sued by several agencies and individuals for its claims of self-driving.

The EV designer has confirmed in an SEC filing that the DOJ has requested documents linked to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features. Tesla says that no government body has determined \"wrongdoing\" as part of an active investigation, but warns that enforcement could have a \"material adverse impact\" on its business.\n\nTesla didn't detail the nature of the request, and doesn't usually comment on issues since disbanding its communications team. We've asked the DOJ for comment. However, it comes after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigated 35 crashes where Autopilot or FSD was reportedly involved, including collisions with emergency vehicles. California's DMV and other officials have accused Tesla of falsely suggesting that its cars are truly driverless when even FSD frequently requires intervention. The state DMV and the NHTSA are worried Tesla drivers might grow complacent and fail to take evasive action when necessary.\n\nThe brand has issued mixed messages on its cars' abilities. While Tesla's support site make clear that Autopilot and FSD don't represent complete autonomy and require a \"fully attentive driver,\" the FSD marketing page claims that you'll only need to \"tell your car where to go.\" Company chief Elon Musk has long promised that true self-driving is just around the corner, but mentioned in October 2022 that Tesla was \"not saying it's quite ready\" to go driverless. FSD remains in beta, although it's now open to anyone who has paid to unlock the functionality.\n\nThe DOJ investigation comes as Tesla and its leadership face mounting scrutiny over their practices. Musk is embroiled in a shareholder lawsuit over his tweets about taking Tesla private. The National Labor Relations Board recently accused Tesla of breaking the law by asking Florida staff to keep quiet about pay and a firing. There are also lingering questions about build quality following a string of recalls.

Ford said it will reach out to customers who purchased the Mustang Mach-E after January 1, 2023 and already have taken possession of the vehicle. The move is clearly aimed at distinguishing itself from rival Tesla. Some new Tesla owners, particularly in China, have demanded rebates or credit after the company slashed prices.\n\nTesla has discounted its vehicles, or offered credits, at least four times in the past several months, kicking off what many in the industry have dubbed an EV price war. The price reduction trend kicked off in October when Tesla announced price cuts in China up to 9% on the Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla reduced prices for Chinese buyers in January by nearly 14% and as much as 20% for vehicles sold in North America.\n\nThe company has also tried to woo U.S. and Canadian buyers with price reductions. Tesla in early December offered U.S. buyers a $3,750 credit toward a Model Y or Model 3 if they had their vehicle delivered in December 2022. In the last week of the year, the automaker upped that discount to $7,500, according to the company's website.\n\nTesla's decision to drop the price of its EVs, which some analysts have suggested was due to softening demand, has put pressure on the rest of the industry. Tesla has among the highest profit margins in the business, allowing it to experiment with price changes.

But then tech stocks collapsed, with Tesla hit much harder than its peers.\n\nAt its 52-week low on 6 January, Tesla stock crashed to $101.81, before rebounding.

Also, the cheap money to bet on the stock comes from short-dated options \u2014 financial derivatives that magnify gains (and losses).

Some, such as General Motors , are asking luxury dealers to go all-in on EVs or get out of the business. Others like Ford Motor are offering dealers different \"EV-certification\" levels, while most other carmakers, or OEMs, know they need to change the sales process to fit the evolving industry, but are still try to figure out how to do it. \"I think we're all building this airplane as we fly,\" Michael Alford, president of the National Auto Dealers Association, a trade association that represents more than 16,000 U.S. new franchised dealers, told CNBC. \"Depending on the OEM, the level of engagement or the intensity of the engagement varies.\" Automakers and franchised dealers have a complex relationship that is backed, in many states, by laws that make it difficult, if not illegal, to bypass franchised dealers and sell new vehicles directly to consumers. (Tesla and other newer EV startups have worked around such regulations to cut costs.) Both automakers and franchised dealers want to maximize profits, but they're separate businesses that heavily rely on one another to succeed. Dealers rely on automakers for product to fill and move off lots, and the carmakers in turn rely on dealers to sell and service vehicles as well as serve as concierges for customers. How that historical relationship fits into an all-electric future is expected to be at the forefront of discussions between automakers and dealers at the National Auto Dealers Association Show occurring through Sunday in Dallas. The event attracts thousands of franchise dealers annually to hear from their respective automotive brands. For dealers \u2014 from mom-and-pop shops to large publicly traded chains \u2014 EVs will mean new employee training, infrastructure and substantial investments in their stores to be able to service, sell and charge the vehicles. Depending on the size of the dealer, those upgrades could easily cost hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars. Of course, they want to make sure their investments will pay off. \"The tone and tenor of this subject matter has evolved, and I think it's very, very clear this year that our legacy OEMs absolutely realize that we are essential going forward,\" said Alford, who runs Chevrolet and Cadillac dealerships in North Carolina.\n\nCompeting with Tesla\n\nAs more automakers introduce EVs, they're rethinking the sales process, including","Entities":["General Motors","Dallas","Ford Motor","the National Auto Dealers Association","U.S.","Alford","Tesla","Chevrolet","EV","CNBC","Cadillac","the National Auto Dealers Association Show","Michael Alford","North Carolina","OEM"]}

However, this FTSE 100 stock has \u00a31bn invested across both companies, giving me an indirect way of investing in their growth. Should I buy the stock today?\n\nFinding Tesla\n\nUntil last year, James Anderson was the long-time manager of Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (LSE: SMT). Under his tenure, the aim of the trust was to find stocks which had the potential to go up many times in value.\n\nIn 2013, he invested in a quirky little firm called Tesla, which was aiming to build the world\u2019s first desirable electric vehicle (EV) brand. Adjusted for stock splits, the shares were trading for around $2.\n\nMost investors thought Tesla stock was overvalued at the time (and still do now). However, Anderson backed Musk\u2019s vision for the company and held the position through thick and think. And though the trust sold most of its holding in 2020 \u2014 making a return of over 100 times its original investment \u2014 Tesla remains a top portfolio holding today.\n\nSupport rewarded\n\nThis patient backing of Tesla was rewarded in 2018 when Baillie Gifford (who run the trust) were invited to participate in SpaceX\u2019s latest funding round. Unlike in public markets, large private companies like SpaceX get to chose their investors. The company wanted long-term backers, and Scottish Mortgage had proven its credentials with Tesla in that regard.\n\nThe \u00a310.7bn trust has topped up its position in SpaceX multiple times since. The holding today makes up 3.6% of its portfolio. Combined with Tesla, the stake is worth \u00a31bn.\n\nSpaceX and Tesla today\n\nLast month, SpaceX was valued at $137bn. Why so much? Well, the company is pioneering the recycling of rockets, which is enormously reducing the cost of getting to space.\n\nIts Starlink satellite-internet operation now has 3,300 tiny satellites in orbit. This has the potential to provide high-speed internet access to the whole planet (and earn many billions in revenue). Starlink is aiming for a constellation of 42,000 satellites.\n\nSeparately, SpaceX is preparing to launch Starship, the most powerful rocket in history.

Analyst Mark Delaney, who maintained a Buy rating and $200 price target on the stock, reiterated his case in a note following Tesla's earnings on Wednesday. The price target assumes about a 25% upside from the stock's current levels.\n\n\"Given the focus of investors on Tesla's delivery volumes in particular (and the importance of volume for its vertically integrated model and the cost benefits long-term of its newer factories when at scale),\" Delaney wrote, \"we see the order strength as the most important takeaway from the call.\"\n\nThe bullish note on Tesla comes after the company reported a mixed fourth-quarter and full-year outlook. Tesla's fourth-quarter gross profit margin came in at 23.8%, short of estimates of 25.4%. The automotive gross profit margin clocked in at 25.9%, compared to analyst estimates of 28.4%.\n\nDuring the earnings call with investors, Tesla CEO Elon Musk did his best to sound enthusiastic about Tesla's business. He also addressed demand concerns, stating: \"Thus far in January we have seen the strongest orders year to date ever in our history.\" However, he also warned of a \"severe\" recession this year.\n\nThe economic warning appears to have been baked into Tesla's 2023 volume growth guidance of 38%, which fell below a longer-term target of 50%.

During a conference call discussing Tesla's latest earnings, company chief Elon Musk said mass production of the electric pickup won't begin until 2024. He still expects manufacturing to kick off \"sometime this summer,\" but warned that output would be \"very slow\" early on. Tesla is still in the midst of installing assembly equipment.\n\nTesla unveiled the Cybertruck in 2019, but has delayed its release multiple times. The company also warned that the final specs and pricing will change. The EV was originally supposed to start at $39,900 in its single-motor configuration and climb to nearly $70,000 for the tri-motor version. While the automaker is still taking deposits, it's no longer promising specific configurations. The pandemic, a rough economy, longstanding supply chain issues and design tweaks are all expected to influence what you can ultimately buy.\n\nThis isn't a new problem for Tesla. Production of the Model 3 started in July 2017, but was very limited until mid-2018 as the company struggled to clear factory bottlenecks. The Cybertruck poses unique challenges, however. Its signature cold-rolled steel body is said to be extra-tough, but also requires manufacturing techniques not normally used for cars. Most production is expected to take place at the Giga Texas factory near Austin, which formally opened last April.\n\nThe revised timeline may create problems. The Cybertruck is already entering a fiercer competitive landscape that includes the Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Hummer EV and Rivian R1T. By the time Tesla's production is in full swing, it will likely have to take on the Ram 1500 EV and Chevy Silverado EV as well as more affordable versions of existing trucks. An electric pickup is no longer the novelty it was four years ago, and it's not clear if the finished Cybertruck will offer major advantages over its rivals.","Entities":["Elon Musk","Giga","Chevy","Ford","Tesla","EV","Austin","Cybertruck","Texas","GMC Hummer EV"]}

After shedding more than $700bn in market valuation during 2022, the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer appeared to be in the middle of a deflating bubble alongside a number of US growth stocks.\n\nHowever, the rebound in the Tesla share price that started this year has accelerated in recent days, with a 34% gain since the beginning of January. Yesterday, the business revealed record fourth-quarter results for 2022 even as its margins shrank.\n\nTesla reported $24.32bn in revenue for Q4 2022, which represents a 37% year-on-year increase. This narrowly beat the consensus forecast of $24.16bn and it\u2019s the highest ever figure for the business.\n\nThe company\u2019s profit figures were even more impressive.

While Tesla as a whole closed the quarter with a 16% operating margin, automotive gross margins came in at 25.9%, which is the lowest figure in the last five quarters.\n\nMargins in the first quarter of 2023 might look worse, says Eric Schiffer, a Tesla investor and the CEO of private equity firm Patriarch Organization.\n\n\"The outlook will still depend on the recent moves of Q1, which suggest some compression in demand,\" Schiffer told TechCrunch, referring to January's price cuts.\n\nThe company acknowledged that average sales prices have \"generally been on a downward trajectory for many years\" and said the company would prioritize \"affordability\" so that it could grow into a company that sells multiple millions of cars annually. That will likely be a necessity for the automaker as it, along with everyone else, faces macroeconomic pressures, a looming recession and increasing competition from other automakers.\n\n\"Tesla is not immune from the recession, and I still expect to see more recession-driven market pain,\" said Schiffer.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 405,278 in the fourth quarter. While those were record deliveries, the automaker still missed Wall Street estimates for the third quarter in a row. Similarly, Tesla's 1.3 million vehicle deliveries in 2022 was also a record for the automaker, but that number misses Tesla's own guidance of achieving 50% growth YoY and getting to 1.4 million deliveries.\n\nRegardless, Tesla still intends to grow production as quickly as possible \"in alignment with the 50% CAGR target we began guiding to in early 2021,\" and reach 1.8 million cars in 2023.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tesla announced plans to invest an additional $3.6 billion into","Entities":["Patriarch Organization","Yahoo Finance","Tesla","TechCrunch","Q4","Eric Schiffer","YoY","Schiffer"]}

That's despite Musk trying to insert himself into the annual event with antagonistic tweets.\n\nThe bottom line is that the stock market and Corporate America does not revolve around Elon Musk, Twitter, Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, or anything else tied to the mega-billionaire.\n\nTesla founder Elon Musk attends Offshore Northern Seas 2022 in Stavanger, Norway August 29, 2022.

The Model 3 Performance variant saw a price cut of $9,000 to $53,990. As for the Model Y Long Range, the price was dropped $13,000 to $52,990. The Performance model was cut to $56,990, about $13,000 cheaper than the prior price.\n\nThe U.S. discounts come hot on the heels of recent price reductions in China, Japan, and South Korea as Tesla looks to reignite demand against growing competitive threats. As long as the market believes Tesla will use price drops to stoke demand, the stock is likely to stay under pressure as investors attempt to model 2023 earnings power for the electric carmaker.\n\nSecond, the market needs to hear realistic unit volume growth for Tesla and get comfortable with it.\n\nTesla guided investors to about 50% unit volume growth in 2022 \u2014 the actual figure was 39%. I am hearing whisper numbers for this year around 25% to 30% unit volume growth. Tesla would be wise to forecast something on the lower end of that range and set the stage for beating that guidance.\n\nI think investors would welcome the conservatism this week from an often crazy-bullish management team.\n\nThe bar is high","Entities":["Tesla","Japan","the World Economic Forum","The Model 3 Performance","U.S.","The Boring Company","South Korea","Davos","Musk","China","Corporate America","Norway","REUTERS","Twitter","Elon Musk","NTB","Model 3","Carina Johansen","Stavanger"]}

The stock has seen a huge $700bn wiped off its market value.\n\nTesla might have fallen 50% over the past six months, but it's up 425% over four years. This is a perfect example of why investing should always be for the long term. Because, if I do my research well, and I pick wisely, a quality company will likely perform over the long run.\n\nSo, if I'd invested \u00a31,000 in Tesla four years ago, today I'd have around \u00a35,500. That's due to share price gains and a depreciating pound. Clearly, I'd be a very happy investor, although I'm sure I'd be kicking myself for not cashing out 18 months ago when the share price peaked.\n\nIn forecasting where Tesla's share price might go next, it's important to understand why it tanked in the autumn.\n\nFor a while at least, Tesla appeared to be defying the market, staying strong while growth stocks collapsed all around it. Elon Musk's own commentary, as well as that of investors like Cathie Wood, probably played a part.\n\nBut eventually the bubble burst. Analysts tend to put this down to missing targets, concerns about margins after discounting its EVs, and Musk selling Tesla shares to finance a Twitter takeover. This is in addition to concerns about a worsening economic environment.\n\nTesla was the first company to scale up the use of clean technology to produce desirable vehicles. It remains ahead of the pack in the EV revolution. The firm has money in the bank ($21bn as of September), and it generated free cash flow of $3.3bn in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nBut many investors have questioned the firm's valuation. And for me, even after the share price tanked, those concerns remain. It trades with a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 33.5. And its price-to-sales ratio (5.5) is some way above Chinese EV makers and traditional car manufacturers.\n\nA high P\/E suggests that investors see it as a growth stock. But as there's that substantial distance between Tesla's valuation and that of its peers, I have to ask: can it offer that much more growth than other car stocks?\n\nIt's an incredibly hard question to answer, but recent performance isn't hugely promising.

Importantly, the jury is to assume that Musk\u2019s tweets were false statements and he acted recklessly in posting them.\n\nBut jurors will have to determine whether he (and separately, Tesla) knew these statements were false, as well as whether they were material.

Of course not,\" he added, regarding Twitter's character limits. If you'll recall, Musk famously tweeted in August 2018 that he was \"considering taking Tesla private at $420\" and that he was already able to secure funding. \"Investor support is confirmed,\" he said in a follow-up tweet.\n\nThe CEO later revealed that he was in talks with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which reportedly expressed interest in Tesla as part of the country's bid to lessen its reliance on oil. However, the deal didn't materialize, and he later penned a lengthy post on the automaker's website to say that it's staying public.\n\nAs CNBC notes, shareholders blamed those \"funding secured\" tweets for their significant financial losses, leading them to file a class action lawsuit against Musk. Tesla's shares apparently remained highly volatile in the weeks that followed. The executive, however, downplayed his tweets' impact and said that they don't necessarily affect stock prices: \"There have been many cases where I thought that if I were to tweet something, the stock price would go down. For example, at one point I tweeted that I thought that, in my opinion, the stock price was too high...and it went went higher, which was, which is, you know, counterintuitive.\"\n\nIn addition to the shareholder lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Musk over his tweets, calling them \"false and misleading statements\" that could be constituted as fraud. Musk and Tesla paid $20 million each to settle with the SEC, and the executive had to step down as board chairman. The SEC also required company lawyers to approve any Tesla-related tweet Musk makes \u2014 a condition the CEO tried (and failed) to get out of last year.\n\nAside from defending his tweets, Musk criticized short sellers during his testimony, telling the court that short-selling \"should be made illegal.\" He added: \"It is a means for, in my opinion, bad people on Wall Street to steal money from investors.

But that is not the only thing about the company that has been gaining speed lately. Tesla stock has jumped 19% since the year started less than three weeks ago.\n\nThat comes after a period of poor performance. Tesla stock has fallen 61% over the past year.\n\nStill, looking at the chart, I wonder if in future we might look back on early 2023 as the moment the EV stock turned the corner and started moving upwards again.\n\nConsidering that, should I buy some for my portfolio now?\n\nGood news and bad news\n\nI think the move upwards reflects a renewed burst of optimism from some investors. I see good reasons behind that. In the final quarter of last year, Tesla delivered over 405,000 vehicles to buyers. Deliveries last year showed annual growth of 40%, with production up 47%.\n\nTesla\u2019s manufacturing footprint has expanded, enabling it to keep ramping up output this year.

But there is bad news too.\n\nRivals are aggressively launching their own EVs. I expect the market to grow strongly in 2023, with Tesla just one player among many.

That dizzying price-to-earnings ratio could become even higher if big price cuts lead to smaller profits this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy contrast, rival Ford has a market capitalisation of $50bn despite making $17bn last year.

The so-called \u2018Oracle of Omaha\u2019 is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and has a net-worth of over $100bn as of November 2022, making him the world\u2019s sixth-wealthiest person.\n\nValue investing is a strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. So why isn\u2019t Buffett buying shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)?\n\nThe Elon Musk firm has seen $700bn wiped off its market value over the past 18 months, most of it in the past four months. Maybe this electric vehicle (EV) giant is still too expensive.\n\nLooking specifically at the last year, BYD \u2014 a Chinese automotive firm with a heavy leaning towards the EV market \u2014 has fallen 15%. But that\u2019s nothing compared to its peers. Tesla stock is down 65% over 12 months.\n\nAnd despite Tesla\u2019s huge sell-off, it\u2019s still more expensive that BYD, according to several metrics. For example, Tesla has an EV-to-sales ratio of 4.58 versus BYD\u2019s 2.04.\n\nHowever, according to earnings-related metrics, Tesla and BYD share similar valuations. The EV-to-EBITDA ratio of Tesla is 21, while BYD\u2019s is 26. In fact, here, BYD appears more expensive. So maybe valuation isn\u2019t the reason?\n\nWell, there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty about Tesla\u2019s earnings going forward. Growth is slow and margins are coming under pressure. That\u2019s very concerning for investors and it makes the above calculations slightly meaningless.\n\nTesla had boosted the best margins in the sector, but with price cuts in the US and extended sales incentives in China, margins are likely to come under substantial pressure. Despite these incentives, Tesla still missed its delivery targets in the final quarter.\n\nAs a value investor, Buffett looks for companies that are undervalued and offer him a margin of safety. And with concerns about Tesla\u2019s performance over the next few years, valuation could well be the issue.\n\nBuffett tends to invest in stable and occasionally unexciting companies. I\u2019d wonder if Musk might be a little too \u2018eccentric\u2019 for the 92-year-old investor. After all, Musk once said that he thought his own company was overvalued.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said the the cuts are the \u201cright medicine at the right time.\u201d\n\nIn a note to clients today, Ives argued that lowering prices was the correct strategic move as demand may be waning and competition is heating up.\n\nIn addition to cutting prices for the Model 3 and Model Y in several European countries, Tesla cut prices for those models in a big way in the U.S., likely in the name of boosting demand and to bring these cars under the price caps for the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s EV tax credit.\n\nStarting with the Model 3, the RWD version goes from $46,990 to $43,990, a 6.4% drop. Even bigger, the Model 3 Performance goes from $62,990 to $53,990, representing a 14.3% price cut. Note that the IRA tax credit maximum price for cars like the Model 3 is $55,000.\n\nFor the popular Model Y SUV, even bigger price cuts have arrived. The Model Y Long Range goes from $65,990 to $52,990, a nearly 20% drop. The Model Y Performance goes from $69,900 to $56,990, an almost a 19% drop.

This would then make the Model 3 and Model Y, as well as other competitors, more expensive, thus pulling forward demand further in Q1.\n\nAn even bigger concern is margin compression.

Tesla\u2019s market value has fallen by more than two-thirds from more than $1.2tn in November 2021 to less than $400bn.\n\nThe fall in value has meant that Elon Musk, its chief executive and major shareholder, is no longer the world\u2019s richest person and has broken the world record for the largest loss of personal fortune in history, according to a Guinness World Records report. The distraction of Musk\u2019s takeover of social network Twitter is also thought to have contributed to the decline in the carmaker\u2019s value.\n\nTesla shares, which are listed on New York\u2019s Nasdaq stock exchange, dropped by 6% in pre-market trading on Friday.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said the company had seen \u201ca normalisation of some of the cost inflation\u201d after \u201ca turbulent year of supply chain disruptions\u201d which allowed it to cut costs for customers.\n\nThe price of the cheapest Model 3 saloon car, the rear-wheel drive version, dropped by \u00a35,500 to \u00a342,990. The cheapest Model Y crossover dropped to \u00a344,990, although the biggest cut was applied to the most expensive Performance version, which dropped by \u00a38,000 to \u00a359,990.\n\nIn the US the entry-level version of its Model Y now costs $52,990 (\u00a343,526), down from $65,990 \u2013 a 20% drop that will mean the vehicle qualifies for US tax credits. The Model 3 dropped to $43,990, a $3,000 reduction.\n\nDan Ives, an analyst at US investment bank Wedbush, said that the US and European price cuts were \u201ceye-popping\u201d and that investors would probably respond negatively. He added that an \u201cEV price war\u201d between manufacturers was now under way.\n\nHowever, he said it was the \u201cright strategic poker move by Musk\u201d, and that the cuts could increase deliveries by between 12% and","Entities":["Elon Musk","Dan Ives","China","The Model 3","Guinness World Records","Tesla","Model 3","New York\u2019s","US","Model Y","Twitter","Musk","Wedbush"]}

It has now fallen 75% since its peak in November 2021.\n\nIt marks yet another turbulent year for Tesla founder and chief executive Elon Musk too, who has now suffered the largest ever financial loss in history. His personal fortune, mostly in Tesla shares, fell an estimated $182bn.\n\nInevitably, investors now divide into two camps. Those who think Tesla has been driven into a ditch as Musk gets distracted by his $44bn Twitter purchase, and a loyal hardcore who reckon this is a massive opportunity to buy its stock on the cheap.\n\nTesla\u2019s valuation is a lot more tempting than it was. Its price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio topped a staggering 1,274 in December 2020. Today\u2019s 12-month P\/E ratio looks dirt-cheap by comparison at 21.38 times earnings. Yet that\u2019s still more than four times General Motors\u2019 current 5.18 times earnings while Ford is at 5.81 times.\n\nHigher lithium costs won\u2019t help. Nor will the risk of future Chinese Covid lockdowns, as the country is a huge market for Tesla. The IMF forecasts a third of the world to tip into recession this year, which will make the going even stickier. Then we have the whole Twitter furore, which has become politically poisonous, and a distraction for Musk.\n\nLest we forget, Tesla is profitable, with Q3 revenues of $21.45bn and net income of $3.3bn, boosted by energy storage and regulatory credit revenues.\n\nThe share price is up around 15% year-to-date, which will tempt some. But I\u2019m wary, as this could be a \u2018dead cat bounce\u2019.\n\nOnce the US Federal Reserve pivots on interest rates, growth stocks like Tesla should swing back into favour. Yet I don\u2019t expect a return to the glory days of US tech. Interest rates will probably never be as low again, nor will stimulus be as high, or investors as credulous. Tesla has to tackle much tougher terrain today.\n\nI find it hard to bet against Elon Musk though. The man is some kind of genius, even if his harsher critics say otherwise.

The least expensive EV, the Model 3 RWD, has dropped from $46,990 to $43,990, while the 5-seat Model Y Long Range fell 20 percent from $65,990 to $52,990. That means the latter model now qualifies for the $7,500 US Federal Tax credit, so the final price drop will be $20,500 \u2014 over 30 percent.\n\nAll other models, including the Model S and Model X (both regular and plaid versions) and the performance versions of the Model 3 and Model Y saw price cuts. However, the 7-seat option on the Model Y has increased in price by $1,000 to $4,000. While that puts the price over $55,000, it still qualifies for the Tax Credit as it's considered to be an SUV. In Germany, Model 3 and Y prices were cut by one to 17 percent, and also dropped in Austria, Switzerland and France.\n\nTo receive the full $7,500 rebate, customers will have to order before mid-March, when it's expected to be reduced to half that. The tax rebates apply to SUVs priced below $80,000 and cars under $55,000. The Model Y fell into both categories, depending on the number of seats, meaning certain 5-seat models weren't eligible \u2014 something CEO Elon Musk called \" messed up .\" Now, all Model Y EVs except the Performance version appear to qualify.\n\nLate last year, it was reported that Tesla inventory was building up after years of strong sales, first with reports in Chin a, then the US . Tesla recently cut prices in China, then later declined any compensation to customers who complained. The Model 3 now starts at 229,900 yuan ($33,425) in that nation.\n\nNeither Tesla nor CEO Elon Musk have weighed in on the price cuts, but potential buyers will no doubt be pleased (and recent purchasers displeased). The Model 3 was originally supposed to cost $35,000 and shipped in that configuration for a short time, but saw steady increases to the $46,990 price announced in March 2022 . Last month, Musk said that \"radical interest rate changes\" had affected vehicle affordability and that Tesla could potentially lower prices.","Entities":["the Model 3 and","Austria","Tesla","EV","the Tax Credit","Switzerland","Model Y Long Range","France","Musk","China","The Model 3","Chin","Model Y EVs","Elon Musk","Model X","Germany","Model 3","US","Model Y","Model"]}

It also cut prices in Austria, Switzerland and France.\n\nFor a U.S. buyer of the long-range Model Y, the new Tesla price combined with the U.S. subsidy that took effect this month amounts to a discount of 31%. In addition, the Tesla move broadened the vehicles in its line-up eligible for the Biden administration tax credit.\n\nBefore the price cut, the five-seat version of the Model Y had been ineligible for that credit, a designation that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had called \"messed up\".

A U-turn on this would be a severe blow to his credibility and Tesla\u2019s share price.\n\nMajor investors have also expressed concern at his time commitment to the social network. It is simplistic but tempting to pin the prospects of Tesla to its CEO, who appears larger than life and is able to make cryptocurrency and shares ebb and flow according to his social media activity.\n\nHowever, the Twitter saga, though colourful, is only part of the picture. Tesla\u2019s nightmare year is more due to a perfect storm of macro factors and slow progress on future products. It is a reckoning that has been coming for some time as the gap between production and deliveries has widened. Lots of things need to go right for it to grow into its huge valuation, a feat that is unlikely in difficult conditions, which leaves it vulnerable to price corrections.\n\nMoreover, it is becoming apparent that Tesla\u2019s much touted \u201cAutopilot\u201d is not on the verge of becoming a revolutionary self-driving system. Failure of a wide FSD (Tesla\u2019s automated driving system) rollout and regulatory struggles have emphasised that wholesale adoption is a while off.\n\nThe delays to the much-vaunted Cybertruck have left investors doubly disappointed. With innovation slowing, Tesla\u2019s rivals have had a chance to catch up. For instance, Volkswagen has released the ID.7 to provide competition for Tesla\u2019s entry level Model 3.\n\nHence, Musk\u2019s antics only bear limited responsibility for Tesla\u2019s difficulties. Despite sometimes hysterical headlines, a sense of perspective is important.

The Elon Musk EV venture is down a whopping 68% over 12 months \u2014 those are some big losses. But as most investors steer clear of the faltering firm, star stock-picker Cathie Wood continues to buy more for her Ark portfolio. In fact, Wood appears to have bought Tesla stock five times for ARKK ETF since December 21. The largest deal was on Tuesday when she bought shares worth more than $19m, based on their closing price of $108.10 the same day.\n\nThere were points during the last year when Tesla appeared to be defying the market, staying strong while growth stocks collapsed all around it. I'm sure a part of that was due to Musk's popular following and their belief in his growth plan. Wood has been a part of that fan club, claiming that Tesla will be in \u201c pole position to dominate \u201d the EV market when the transition truly gets going.\n\nHowever, Tesla's collapse eventually came. In early September, Tesla shares were priced at over $300. Today, they're worth just over $100. The collapses has been influenced by several factors, including Musk selling Tesla shares to finance a Twitter take-over, Tesla missing delivery targets, and concerns about margins.\n\nDespite this mammoth fall in the share price, Tesla still doesn't look that cheap. The company's current price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio (TTM) is 30.5. And it's price-to-sales ratio (5.3) is someway above its non-US peers. But these figures aren't entirely illuminating, and neither is a discounted cash flow calculation. And that's because forecasting what Tesla's earning will look like going forward is getting difficult. Growth is slow and margins are coming under pressure. That's very concerning for investors and it makes the above calculations slightly meaningless.\n\nThere are several reasons I'm not buying Tesla shares. To start with, valuing the firm is very difficult. And while it is clearly the sector leader, it's market-cap is around 10 times greater than its fast-growing Chinese peers.\n\nIn fact, its valuation dwarfs that of any other car company, despite the share price correction, and that concerns me. For one, I find this hard to accept as I'm not convinced it will become the biggest car-producing company in the world.\n\nAnother concern is around slowing growth.

If that growth rate can\u2019t be maintained, Tesla\u2019s high valuation will have to come down to mirror traditional automakers, who have had much more modest growth, and smaller profit margins.\n\nIn a note today to investors, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives laid out that demand concern, writing that yesterday\u2019s delivery numbers leave \u201cinvestors with more questions than answers on the Tesla story","Entities":["Elon Musk","Brinkman","Dan Ives","JPMorgan","Ryan Brinkman","Mark Newton","TD Sequential","Tesla","Newton","Q4","Fundstrat","Twitter","Wedbush"]}

It had risen around 50% in the prior year. I looked at Tesla shares early last year and decided not to buy them. But what would have happened if I did?\n\nTesla shares tanked in 2022\n\nLast year, the shares fell by 65%. That is a sizeable dip. So imagine I had put \u00a3800 into Tesla shares at the start of last year. My shares would have ended the year worth only around \u00a3280.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that Tesla shares trade in dollars. The weak performance of the pound compared to the dollar last year may have eased my pain slightly in this case. The pound lost about 12% of its value relative to the dollar. But my \u00a3800 would have been converted to dollars in January if I had bought the Tesla shares then.\n\nSo holding the dollar-denominated shares would mean I saw some benefit from the stronger dollar if I sold them and put the money back into pounds. Still, if I had done that on the last trading day of 2022, I would have lost more than half my money. Tesla does not pay a dividend so I would not have received any.\n\n2023 has started badly for Tesla shares, with a fall of 12% yesterday after the car firm released its latest sales numbers. So if I had chosen not to sell the shares at the end of December, my paper loss would now be even bigger.\n\nLong-term investing\n\nStill, I am a long-term investor. Despite Tesla shares crashing last year, they are still up 412% in the past five years.\n\nIn other words, excluding currency conversion, if I had invested \u00a3800 in the company five years ago, I would now have a holding worth nearly \u00a34,100. That is a very impressive return.\n\nSo does the falling share price present a buying opportunity for my portfolio as we start 2023? Or might they still be overvalued relative to the company's long-term worth, even after last year's sharp fall?\n\nMy plan for 2023\n\nFor now, I continue to see the shares as overpriced. Even after yesterday's sharp drop on top of last year's weak performance, the company has a market capitalisation of over $300bn. It trades on a price-to-earnings ratio of over 60. I regard that as a pricy.\n\nHowever, earnings may improve sharply in the next few years","Entities":["Tesla"]}

It was the worst year ever for Tesla shares, which gained 743% in 2020 and another 50% in 2021.\n\nThe drop in sales came despite the company's two price cuts in December for US buyers who completed their purchase by year end. The fact that global sales were well short of the 439,000 cars it built in the period raised new concerns about weakening demand for Tesla cars in the face of numerous headwinds. These include higher interest rates, increased EV competition from established automakers along with upstart EV makers, and backlash against Tesla CEO Elon Musk since his controversial takeover of Twitter early in the quarter.\n\n\"Demand overall is starting to crack a bit for Tesla and the company will need to adjust and cut prices more especially in China, which remains the key to the growth story,\" said Dan Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. \"The Cinderella ride is over for Tesla.\"","Entities":["Elon Musk","Dan Ives","China","Cinderella","Tesla","EV","Refinitiv","US","Wedbush Securities","Twitter","Musk"]}

Since then, they\u2019re down 70% \u2013 and they\u2019re falling further in pre-market trading today.\n\nOne reason Tesla shares have been falling recently is CEO Elon Musk selling the stock. But the investment proposition comes down to the business itself.\n\nSo what about Tesla?\n\nFirst things first \u2013 how much cash does Tesla need to generate for its shares to be a worthwhile investment? For me, the answer is $13.65bn per year.\n\nRight now, a UK 10-year government bond comes with a 3.66% yield. As a result, Tesla shares need to offer at least that over the next decade to be a bargain.\n\nAt the moment, Tesla has a market cap of just under $382bn. But there\u2019s more to the stock than just its price tag.\n\nThe company has $8.9bn in debt and $17.6bn in cash on its balance sheet. That gives it a total enterprise value of around $373bn.\n\nA 3.66% annual return on a $373bn outlay amounts to $13.65bn in free cash per year over the next decade. That\u2019s what I think Tesla needs to produce for its stock to be a bargain right now.\n\nIf interest rates go higher (as I think they will) then the equation might change. But with bond yields where they are, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for from Tesla as a potential investor.\n\nOver the last 12 months, Tesla has generated $8.9bn in free cash. That\u2019s some way short of the $13.65bn it needs to average to be a bargain for investors.\n\nIn order to average $13.65bn per year, the company needs to grow its free cash flow at around 10% per year. So can Tesla do it?\n\nI think there\u2019s reason to think that it can. The company has been growing its revenues at around 44% annually over the last five years.\n\nOn top of that, margins have been expanding. As a result, its free cash flow has been growing faster than its revenue.\n\nThe company just announced that its deliveries for Q4 2022 were below expectations. But they were still up 30%.\n\nA recession is likely to challenge Tesla\u2019s growth, but 10% per year doesn\u2019t look overly demanding to me.

It produced nearly 1.4 million vehicles, up 47% from the prior year.\n\nYet the fourth quarter underwhelmed: Tesla delivered only 405,278 vehicles, well below the median estimate of 431,000 according to analysts polled by Refinitiv, as recession fears and higher interest rates led to a slowdown in demand.\n\nAlthough 40% growth is nothing to sneeze at, Tesla\u2019s pace of growth is slowing.

The company missed its growth targets throughout the year and it scaled back production in China.\n\nEvidence of car buyers\u2019 sinking interest in Teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare sale in a bid to clear out inventory. Tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year, initially offering a $3,750 discount then doubling the rebate to $7,500 with two weeks left in 2022.\n\nInvestors were rattled by the rebates, sending the stock plunging 37% in December alone.\n\nTesla thanked customers and employees for helping the company \u201cachieve a great 2022 in light of significant Covid and supply chain related challenges throughout the year,\u201d according to a statement released on Monday.\n\nThe company also said it was proud of its growth and progress.\n\n\u201cWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter,\u201d the statement read.\n\nTesla said it delivered 1.25 million of its less-expensive Model 3 and Model Y electric cars, and nearly 67,000 of its higher-end Model X and Model X lines.","Entities":["China","Covid","Tesla","Model 3","Refinitiv","Teslas","Model"]}

That number represents a new record for the company, but it also fell short of Wall Street estimates. As recently as December 30th, the consensus among most analysts was that Tesla would deliver about 418,000 vehicles in Q4. A year earlier, the company delivered 308,600 cars during the same period.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the Model 3 and Model Y made up most of the company's deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022, with 388,131 of those vehicles making their way to consumers before the end of the year. Comparatively, Tesla's more expensive Model S and Model X cars accounted for a modest 17,147 deliveries over the same time frame. Tesla produced 439,701 vehicles in the fourth quarter, setting another record.\n\nIt's fair to say the end of 2022 could have gone better for Tesla. Even before considering how much Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter has hurt the company, Tesla was faced with macroeconomic and logistical challenges threatening to slow growth. As they did earlier in the year, COVID-19 restrictions in China forced Tesla to suspend and reduce production at its Shanghai Gigafactory. Tesla also closed the facility during the last week of December, adding to concerns the company has been dealing with weakening demand in the world's biggest automotive market. In Q4, Tesla also had trouble securing transportation for completed vehicles.\n\nSeparately, Elon Musk's handling of Twitter and repeat Tesla stock selloffs saw the value of the company's shares drop dramatically. In December, Tesla's stock fell 33 percent (and 45 percent over the last six months) before rallying in anticipation of the company's fourth-quarter numbers.

These numbers represented a new record for the Elon Musk-led automaker and growth of 40% in deliveries year-over-year.\n\nHowever, the fourth quarter numbers fell shy of analysts' expectations.\n\nAccording to a consensus of analysts' estimates compiled by FactSet, as of Dec. 31, 2022 Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 427,000 for the final quarter of the year. Estimates updated in December, and included in the FactSet consensus, ranged from 409,000 to 433,000.\n\nThose more recent estimates were in line with a company-compiled consensus distributed by Tesla investor relations Vice President Martin Viecha. That consensus, published by electric vehicle industry researcher @TroyTeslike, said that 24 sell-side analysts expected Tesla deliveries of about 417,957 on average for the quarter (and about 1.33 million deliveries for the full year).\n\nTesla started production at two new factories this year \u2014 in Austin, Texas and Brandenburg, Germany \u2014 and ramped up production in Fremont, California and in Shanghai, but it does not disclose production and delivery numbers by region.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Tesla said deliveries of its entry level Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover amounted to 325,158, while deliveries of its higher end Model S sedan and Model X SUV amounted to 18,672.\n\nIn its third-quarter shareholder presentation, Tesla wrote: \"Over a multi-year horizon we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity, factory uptime, operational efficiency and the capacity and stability of the supply chain.\"\n\nThe period ending Dec. 31, 2022 was marked by challenges for Tesla, including Covid outbreaks in China, which caused the company to temporarily suspend and reduce production at its Shanghai factory.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, Tesla also offered steep price cuts and other promotions in the U.S., China and elsewhere in order to spur demand, even though doing so could put pressure on its margins.\n\nIn a recent e-mail to Tesla staff, Elon Musk asked employees to \"volunteer\" to deliver as many cars to customers as possible before the end of 2022. In his e-mail, Musk also encouraged employees not to be \"bothered\" by what he characterized as \"stock market craziness","Entities":["Brandenburg","Martin Viecha","Covid","Tesla","Austin","U.S.","Model S","Fremont","Texas","California","Musk","FactSet","China","Elon Musk","Model X","Germany","Model 3","Model Y","Shanghai"]}

Tesla started offering a $7,500 discount and 10,000 Supercharging miles on these vehicles during the last few days of 2022.\n\nInventory withered and customers took advantage of the offers Tesla had, which should bode well for the company\u2019s delivery figures for Q4 and the full year. However, the attention is already turning to what Tesla could accomplish in 2023.
