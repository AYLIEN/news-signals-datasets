      "Body: The match between AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence program developed by DeepMind, and Lee Sedol, a professional Go player, was a significant moment in the history of AI and board games.\n",
      "This five-game series, held in March 2016, demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning in a game known for its complexity.\n",
      " Background of Go and challenges for AIGo is an ancient board game that originated in China over 2,500 years ago. The game is played on a 19x19 grid, where two players place black and white stones to control territory alternately. Unlike chess, where computers had already achieved dominance over human players, Go remained a challenge for AI due to its vast number of possible board configurations and the reliance on intuition rather than fixed strategies. Traditional AI approaches struggled to evaluate positions effectively, making human expertise critical in high-level play.\n",
      " Development of AlphaGoAlphaGo was developed by DeepMind, a company owned by Google, using deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. The system was trained on thousands of professional and amateur games, improving its strategies through self-play. It combined two neural networks: the policy network, which predicted the best moves, and the value network, which assessed board positions. This approach allowed AlphaGo to develop unconventional strategies that differed from human playstyles.\n",
      " The give-game series between AI and humanThe match between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol took place in Seoul, South Korea. Lee Sedol was one of the strongest Go players in the world, having won multiple international titles. The structure of the match was a best-of-five format, with AlphaGo and Lee competing under standard tournament rules.\n",
      " Game 1: AlphaGo won by playing moves that disrupted traditional human strategies. Lee Sedol struggled to predict the AI's unconventional patterns.\n",
      " Game 2: AlphaGo secured another victory by demonstrating a precise reading of board positions.\n",
      " Game 3: AlphaGo won again, ensuring its overall match victory. The AI displayed strategic depth and adaptability.\n",
      " Game 4: Lee Sedol achieved a breakthrough, winning his first and only game. A creative move in the middle match forced AlphaGo into mistakes.\n",

      " Impact on AI and GoThe match had lasting effects on both AI research and the Go community. For AI, AlphaGo's victory showed that deep learning and reinforcement learning could solve problems previously considered too complex for computers. The techniques used in AlphaGo were later applied to other domains, including healthcare and scientific research.\n",
      " In the Go community, AlphaGo's strategies introduced new possibilities for professional players. The AI's approach to the game led to a reevaluation of established techniques, influencing modern playstyles.\n",

      "    Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide, and asset management is no exception. While many financial institutions have recently started exploring AI-driven investment strategies, Smart Wealth has been refining its AI capabilities for over two decades.\n",
      "  This pioneering approach has led to exceptional performance, including an 11% risk-adjusted return in 2024, outpacing titans like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.\n",
      "  Miro Mitev, CEO and Founder of Smart Wealth, believes AI is reshaping asset management and that AI-driven investing can align with ethical and social goals.\n",
      "  Performance and Strategy: AI as the Ultimate Asset Manager\n",
      "  Achieving an 11% risk-adjusted return in 2024, outperforming some of the biggest names in finance, is no small feat. According to Mitev, Smart Wealth's success lies in its fully AI-driven investment model.\n",
      "  “One of our investors said to us that we are delivering alternative returns on core assets,” Mitev explains.\n",
      "  “The key is our AI-driven approach. Our model is built on removing human biases and limitations from the decision-making process of investments. By leveraging advanced algorithms and analysing over 60,000 data points per second, our AI model is able to identify patterns that even the smartest human minds can't, using them to make evidence-based decisions. With our AI-driven investment approach, we have consistently delivered superior returns for any given level of risk for over twenty years.”\n",
      "  While many asset managers incorporate AI-driven signals into their strategies, Smart Wealth takes AI integration to another level.\n",
      "  “Although many asset managers use AI signals, or recommendations, to help inform their investment decisions, we differentiate ourselves by committing to the technology fully,” Mitev says.\n",
      "  “We set the macro rules and then any human intervention ends. Our AI removes human emotional biases from the investment process, and we have proven many times over that it makes better decisions than human asset managers. Therefore, we treat the AI as our CIO, setting the borders for the AI, such as setting the max weight to a single eligible asset and asset class, then allowing the AI to fully take the reins.”\n",
      "  This approach treats AI as the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), with its decisions determining the firm's asset allocation. Human involvement is limited to setting broad parameters—such as the maximum weight of an asset class—before the AI takes full control.\n",
      "  AI's role in the Future of Asset Management\n",
      "  Smart Wealth's journey in AI-powered asset management began long before most firms even considered AI a viable tool.\n",
      "  Story Continues\n",
      "  “This journey began at Siemens when our team pioneered a groundbreaking approach to asset management by launching the world's first financial product based on artificial intelligence in cooperation with leading financial institutions,” Mitev says.\n",
      "  With over 20 years of refining and optimising AI-driven investment models, Smart Wealth has built a competitive edge that newer AI adopters struggle to match.\n",
      "  “With our AI operating as a continuously learning model, early adoption provides a significant advantage. It has evolved through multiple cycles, and we have gained the experience of how to optimise the context it works in. Whilst we acknowledge that no system can be completely error-free, our AI leverages its past mistakes to improve and refine its decision-making processes. With over two decades of experience in asset management, the model consistently delivers market outperformance.”\n",
      "  Future of AI in asset management\n",
      "  Mitev predicts dramatic expansion in AI adoption over the next five years but highlights challenges that traditional firms will face in fully integrating AI.\n",
      "  “However, we do recognise the challenges that larger institutions face in fully embracing AI,” he explains. “Current remuneration and client fee models in these companies are built around human teams, with investment decision-makers often regarded as central to the success of wealth management teams globally. This traditional structure makes it more difficult for these larger, more established organisations to quickly adopt these new technologies that are required to stay ahead and competitive in the industry.”\n",
      "  At Smart Wealth, AI is the foundation of operations rather than an add-on, allowing the company to remain agile and competitive. Mitev believes that as AI takes on more decision-making roles, industry dynamics will shift, potentially leaving traditional firms struggling to keep up.\n",
      "  Competing with Industry Giants and Managing Risk\n",
      "  Consistently beating major asset managers is an impressive achievement, but Mitev remains focused on continued innovation.\n",
      "  “We are proud of our consistent outperformance, but we know that there is still so much left to do, to learn, and to deliver. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is that there is so much potential to match volatility and return for investors. We use AI to develop investment strategies precisely attuned to investor needs and preferences.”\n",
      "  His advice for firms looking to stay ahead? Embrace emerging technologies early.\n",
      "  “If I was to offer advice to other firms, it would be to focus on complementing, not competing with emerging technologies. Embracing innovation at an early stage is also vital, as it provides the opportunity, especially if you are a smaller, more agile firm, to build a competitive edge over larger firms.”\n",
      "  AI-Driven Risk Management\n",
      "  Risk management is at the core of Smart Wealth's AI model.\n",
      "  “It plays a huge role in allowing us to achieve our exceptional risk-adjusted returns. The lack of human bias means that our AI model can respond quickly and objectively to constantly evolving and complex market conditions,” Mitev explains.\n",
      "  “This results in it is recovering in 60% less time than industry benchmarks after downturns.”\n",
      "  A striking example of AI's superior decision-making came during the 2008 financial crisis.\n",
      "  “An anecdote I like to tell to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AI's decision making in economic downturns is its behaviour during the 2008 crisis. It moved its allocation 51% to cash on 19th June 2008, three months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent financial fallout. It reduced the cash to 5% on 17th April 2009, three months before the official end of the financial crisis. Without human biases, our model can identify these signals that often elude human analysts.”\n",
      "  Addressing AI Ethics\n",
      "  As AI takes a more prominent role in finance, ethical considerations become increasingly important.\n",
      "  “AI-driven decision making often presents challenges in assigning accountability as the model's processes can function like a “black box,” Mitev acknowledges. “This highlights the importance of establishing clear parameters and guidelines for how the AI operates. Defining these boundaries ensures the system functions within ethical and operational constraints, ensuring investment decisions are fully aligned with the product's explicit rules.”\n",
      "  He also notes that Smart Wealth's AI does not interact with market participants—it simply analyses data, making it immune to emotional decision-making.\n",
      "  AI's Contribution to Socially Responsible Investing\n",
      "  Beyond superior financial performance, AI-driven investing also has the potential to promote broader societal goals.\n",
      "  “It can support these aims in two ways. Our fee model is lower than industry benchmarks as we don't have the same people costs, so we return more of the returns to our investors,” Mitev says. “We set the macro context for the AI to operate in so we can create products that align with the ethical choices of groups of people.”\n",
      "  He also envisions AI shifting the human capital in finance toward scientific and research-driven innovation.\n",
      "  “AI is going to make many human roles in asset management redundant. However, at the same time, it will create opportunities in other areas. Given that some of the brightest scientific and mathematical minds currently work in finance, I think that the potential for research and innovation is massive as this human capital transitions to other fields.”\n",
      "  Miro Mitev: The Vision Behind Smart Wealth\n",
      "  Mitev's journey into AI-driven asset management was driven by a passion for technology.\n",
      "  “A fascination with technology led me to study AI, and during my PhD studies 25 years ago, I focused on projects that were actually developing AI solutions. When I turned my attention to asset management, the potential was immediately clear—there was already far more data than human minds could effectively process,” he recalls.\n",
      "  His experience also led him to recognise that human biases are nearly impossible to eliminate, reinforcing the need for AI-driven decision-making.\n",
      "  For those looking to leverage AI in any industry, Mitev offers this advice: “My advice, based on our experience, is to think beyond replacing people. The genuine potential of a completely different form of intelligence will likely only be unlocked by reimagining the system itself.”\n",
      "  With AI at the helm, Smart Wealth is redefining asset management. From superior risk-adjusted returns to faster recovery times and ethical investing, the company's two-decade head start in AI innovation gives it a significant edge.\n",
      "  As the industry adapts to AI-driven investing, Miro Mitev's vision offers a glimpse into the future—one where human emotion no longer dictates market decisions and AI unlocks new possibilities in finance and beyond.\n",

      "It produces urine through which the nitrogenous waste products are eliminated from the body. Diabetes and hypertension are the commonest causes of kidney damage and it is essential to know about the common symptoms of kidney dysfunction as below.Some common symptoms of kidney damage are as follows:No symptoms – Early stages of kidney damage do not cause any symptoms and can only be detected through blood tests, urine tests and Blood pressure measurement. Hence it is very important for patients with high risk of developing kidney damage like DM and HT to get their renal function tests at regular intervals even if not symptomatic.Swelling of feet – A common symptom of renal damage is swelling of feet or swelling of face while getting up from sleep. It happens due to the loss of proteins in urine and is a sign of kidney injury. In the initial stages patients may have only transient swelling of the feet after prolonged sitting which disappears after lying down.Frothy urine – It is normal to have frothy urine when passing urine in a full bladder like the first void urine after waking up. However persistent frothy urine needs evaluation to rule out proteinuria – a marker of renal injury.Blood in urine – A scary symptom for many patients and may be due benign causes such as Urinary tract infection or renal stone. However painless hematuria in an elderly smoker must be evaluated for malignancies like Renal Cell carcinoma or Carcinoma urinary bladder.Loss of appetite and tiredness – Usually these are very non specific complaints and patients with advanced renal dysfunction may have these symptoms due to anemia which common in later stages of kidney diseaseChanges in volume of urine – Passing very low volumes of urine (oliguria) and passing excessive volumes of urine (Polyuria) – both are abnormal and needs evaluation of the renal functionsLoin pain – Urinary stones blocking the flow of urine in the urinary tract can cause acute pain in the lumbar area and will need appropriate imaging and management. However its important to note that renal dysfunction alone usually does not cause any pain.Itching – Patients with advanced renal dysfunction can develop multiple skin issues like dryness of skin and severe itchingOthers – Shortness of breath, Changes in taste sense, Bad breath, burning micturition, Loss of weight, Insomnia – Though not specific to renal dysfunction may be associated with renal injury.What is the bottom line:Early stages of renal dysfunction does not have any symptoms or the symptoms are very subtle / non troubling – however most treatment modalities are effective only during this stage. Hence its essential to screen patients at high risk of renal damage with renal function tests at regular intervals.The above list of symptoms are not complete and are non specific in nature (meaning people with other conditions may also have similar symptoms) – hence it is always advisable to consult your family physician if you have any of these symptoms.Dr Navinath M, MD(Med)(AIIMS), DM(Nephro)(AIIMS), DNB(Nephro), MNAMS, Consultant Nephrologist and Renal Transplant Physician, Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology, Nungambakkam, Chennai.Check out the Valentine Week List 2025, along with the Valentine's Week schedule and meaning.\n",

This resource helps transform data into actionable insights, driving better decision-making, improved performance, and measurable growth.\n",
      "  TORONTO Feb. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - Effective dashboards remain a challenge for many organizations, even with experienced teams. Too often, dashboards are built around readily available data rather than strategic business objectives, limiting their ability to drive performance and growth. To address this issue, Info-Tech Research Group has published a comprehensive blueprint, Build Better Dashboards Across Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success , which provides a structured approach for designing dashboards that enhance cross-functional collaboration, track key metrics, and support data-driven decision-making.\n",

      "  \"Without good analytics, reports are just numbers on a page,\" says Terra Higginson , Principal Research Director at Info-Tech Research Group . \"Organizations are sitting on vast amounts of data without a clear strategy to extract value. Our blueprint is designed to help businesses turn raw data into actionable insights, aligning dashboards with goals that drive measurable impact.\"\n",
      "  Dashboards as a Foundation for High-Performing Teams\n",
      "  Info-Tech's research highlights the critical role dashboards play in marketing, sales, and customer success, where real-time data visualization supports performance tracking and strategic decision-making. However, without a well-structured dashboard, organizations risk making decisions based on outdated or incomplete information, ultimately hindering growth and operational efficiency.\n",
      "  \"When analytics are done well, they answer a business question and support the company's business goals,\" explains Higginson. \"These goals cascade down to each department and each person. However, collecting data alone won't drive results because, without business context, data is just meaningless numbers. The magic happens when you start with a clear goal, understand how each department contributes to it, and see the individual roles within that vision. This approach transforms a dashboard from being merely interesting to genuinely insightful.\"\n",
      "  Key Factors for Building Effective Dashboards\n",
      "  In its latest blueprint, the firm outlines eight essential factors for IT and business leaders to consider when developing high-impact dashboards:\n",

      "  Evaluate Data and Select an Analytics Tool: Leverage AI-powered data tools to clean and structure data for accuracy and reliability.\n",
      "  Identify the Data and Sources: Integrate data from multiple platforms through APIs or manual processes for a comprehensive, unified view.\n",
      "  Design the Dashboard: Develop visually compelling and user-friendly dashboards to track real-time marketing, sales, and customer success metrics.\n",
      "  Build Requirements Document: Outline data sources (e.g. CRM, marketing automation, Google Analytics, Excel), field mappings, and workflow alignment across systems.\n",
      "  Establish Regular Reporting Intervals: Set a structured cadence for dashboard updates and reporting to maintain relevance and usability.\n",
      "  Iterate and Improve Dashboards: Regularly test and refine dashboards to enhance insights and maximize value.\n",

      "Body: John Martin, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, UCL  ·  3-min read\n",
      " There are many difficulties in converting any biological research into a medicine that will treat patients. Because of the complexity involved, these difficulties apply especially to translating cell research in the laboratory to a successful treatment for heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly.\n",
      "  The definitive treatment for heart failure is a heart transplant – a difficult and costly procedure. Pills are prescribed for the condition, but they only delay death and are not effective in changing the cause of the disease.\n",
      "  Fifteen to 20 years ago, scientists started enthusiastically exploring the use of heart muscle precursor cells grown in the laboratory to transplant to the failing heart in the hope that they might make new heart muscle. Although results in animal tests were positive, they all failed in humans. Included in the failures was the one that my colleagues and I conducted\n",
      "  We'd had success with animal studies and even some positive results in small groups of patients. Buoyed by these results, we organised a randomised controlled trial – the gold standard for medical studies in humans.\n",
      "  Our study was funded by the European Commission and entailed a massive effort by a large group of researchers across Europe. The result was that the therapy, which entailed injecting bone marrow cells into the heart muscle of patients who had had a heart attack, did not work.\n",
      "  I was therefore surprised to read recently that an article in Nature on this subject had an enthusiastic reception in the press. It was variously described as “groundbreaking” “remarkable” and a “major breakthrough”\n",
      "  The authors of the article report growing patches of heart muscle in the lab from precursor cells and then applying those patches to the hearts of monkeys that had had an induced heart attack, producing heart failure.\n",
      "  A woman who'd had a heart attack in 2016 also had the procedure. Three months later, she had a heart transplant, allowing the researchers to analyse her heart.\n",
      "  As this was the only case of a human receiving this treatment, and the procedure had failed, as the heart was removed from the patient, the title of the Nature article is perhaps too wide in its scope: Engineering heart muscle allografts for heart repair in primates and humans.\n",
      "  It is noted that a senior author of the article declares that he has shares in the company that will commercialise any success. This conflict may have been declared, but it is still a potential conflict.\n",
      "  Heart arrhythmia\n",
      "  The article does not discuss previous attempts to use heart muscle precursor cells for treating heart failure in humans. In particular, the pioneering work in Paris of the surgeon Philippe Menasché who in 2003 reported in the Lancet that he had injected heart muscle precursor cells into the myocardium (heart muscle) of a patient with apparent success.\n",
      "  He then published the results of a study where he repeated the same procedure in a larger group. The study was not successful. Menasché noted that some of the patients suffered from cardiac rhythm abnormalities following the procedure.\n",
      "  There was much discussion in the field that the junctions between the transplanted cells and the patient's own heart muscle cells might give rise to abnormal electrical activity that would unpredictably produce potentially fatal heart rhythm change.\n",
      "  Because of the history of failure of cell therapy in human trials after positive tests in lab animals, the objective reader should regard results from animal experiments with scepticism.\n",

      "  TEX\n",
      "   ^GSPC\n",
      "   Did you analyze how Terex (TEX) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending December 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this machinery products maker, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n",
      "  The global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects.\n",
      "  Being present in foreign markets serves as protection against local economic declines and helps benefit from more rapidly expanding economies. Yet, such expansion also introduces challenges related to currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varied market behaviors.\n",
      "  Upon examining TEX's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\n",
      "  The recent quarter saw the company's total revenue reaching $1.24 billion, marking an improvement of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter. Next, we'll examine the breakdown of TEX's revenue from abroad to comprehend the significance of its international presence.\n",
      "  A Look into TEX's International Revenue Streams\n",
      "  During the quarter, Western Europe contributed $157 million in revenue, making up 12.65% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $231.54 million, this meant a surprise of -32.19%. Looking back, Western Europe contributed $191 million, or 15.76%, in the previous quarter, and $219.2 million, or 17.93%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n",
      "  Asia-Pacific generated $137 million in revenues for the company in the last quarter, constituting 11.04% of the total. This represented a surprise of -18.2% compared to the $167.48 million projected by Wall Street analysts. Comparatively, in the previous quarter, Asia-Pacific accounted for $130 million (10.73%), and in the year-ago quarter, it contributed $178.9 million (14.63%) to the total revenue.\n",
      "  International Market Revenue Projections\n",
      "  The current fiscal quarter's total revenue for Terex, as projected by Wall Street analysts, is expected to reach $1.36 billion, reflecting an increase of 5.1% from the same quarter last year. The breakdown of this revenue by foreign region is as follows: Western Europe is anticipated to contribute 18.9% or $257.14 million and Asia-Pacific 11.3% or $153.7 million.\n",
      "  Story Continues\n",
      "  For the full year, a total revenue of $5.39 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 5.1% from the year before. The revenues from Western Europe and Asia-Pacific are expected to make up 18.3% and 11.6% of this total, corresponding to $987.49 million and $623.95 million respectively.\n",
      "  Closing Remarks\n",
      "  Relying on international markets for revenues, Terex faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\n",
      "  In an era of growing international ties and escalating geopolitical disputes, financial analysts on Wall Street pay keen attention to these developments to fine-tune their earnings estimations for businesses operating across borders. It's important to note, however, that a range of additional variables, like a company's local market status, also play a crucial role in shaping these forecasts.\n",
      "  At Zacks, we place significant importance on a company's evolving earnings outlook. This is based on empirical evidence demonstrating its strong influence on a stock's short -term price movements. Invariably, there exists a positive relationship -- an upward revision in earnings estimates is typically mirrored by a rise in the stock price.\n",
      "  Boasting a remarkable track record that's been externally verified, the Zacks Rank, our unique stock rating system, leverages changes in earnings projections to function as a reliable gauge for predicting short-term stock price movements.\n",
      "  Currently, Terex holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), signifying its potential to underperform the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n",
      "  Reviewing Terex's Recent Stock Price Trends\n",
      "  Over the preceding four weeks, the stock's value has appreciated by 1.7%, against an upturn of 2.1% in the Zacks S&P 500 composite. In parallel, the Zacks Industrial Products sector, which counts Terex among its entities, has appreciated by 1.5%. Over the past three months, the company's shares have seen a decline of 13.9% versus the S&P 500's 1.2% increase. The sector overall has witnessed a decline of 6.5% over the same period.\n",

      "  Despite rattling global tech stocks with competitive artificial intelligence models, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek didn't introduce anything new, a Google ( GOOGL ) executive said.\n",
      "  Google DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis said the Hangzhou-based startup's AI model “is probably the best work” from China, and is “an impressive piece of work,” during a Google event in Paris, CNBC reported . Hassabis said DeepSeek has demonstrated “extremely good engineering,” and that its AI models have deeper geopolitical implications.\n",
      "  However, Hassabis said DeepSeek doesn't show “actual new scientific advance” and is “using known techniques” in the AI industry. He added that the reaction to DeepSeek was “exaggerated a little bit.”\n",
      "  Last month, DeepSeek released results for its latest open-source reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1, which performed comparably to OpenAI's reasoning models, o1-mini and o1, on several industry benchmarks. In December, the startup launched its DeepSeek-V3 models which it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on Nvidia's ( NVDA ) H800 chips — the reduced-capability version of Nvidia's H100 chips used by U.S. firms.\n",
      "  The release of DeepSeek-R1 sparked a global sell-off of tech stocks , sending Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and S&P500 futures falling. Nvidia's stock plunged 17% , wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company. DeepSeek's cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech's big spending on AI infrastructure, as well as how effective U.S. chip export controls are.\n",
      "  Meanwhile, Google made its Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental AI model available to all Gemini app users last week. The AI model currently ranks as the best model in the world on the community-driven Chatbot Arena.\n",
      "  Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental is trained to “strengthen its reasoning capabilities” by breaking down prompts step-by-step and showing users its “thought process” to understand how it came to its response. Through this process, users can see “what its assumptions were, and trace the model's line of reasoning,” Google said.\n",

      "    Make room for yet another partnership on AI: Current AI , which is being billed as a \"public interest\" initiative focused on fostering and steering development of artificial intelligence in societally beneficial directions, was announced at the French AI Action summit on Monday -- with an initial $400 million in pledges from backers and a plan to pull in $2.5 billion over the next five years.\n",
      "  Such figures might seem like small beer when it comes to AI investment, with the French president fresh from trumpeting a private support package worth around $112 billion (which itself pales beside U.S. investments aiming to accelerate the tech ). But the partnership is not focused on compute so its backers believe such relatively modest sums will still be able to make a difference in key areas where AI could make a critical difference to advancing the public interest -- whether in AI for healthcare or supporting climate goals.\n",
      "  Under the top-line focus on \"the enabling environment for public interest AI\", the initiative has a number of stated aims -- including pushing to widen access to \"high quality\" public and private data-sets for AI training; support for open source infrastructure & tooling to boost AI transparency and security; and support for developing systems to measure AI's social and environmental impact.\n",
      "  Its founder, Martin Tisné, said the goal is to create a financial vehicle \"to provide a North Star for public financing of critical efforts\", such as -- for example -- bringing AI to bear on combating cancers or coming up with treatments for long COVID.\n",
      "  \"I think what's happening is you've got a data bottle-neck coming in artificial intelligence, because we're running out of road with data on the web, effectively... and here, what we need is to really unlock innovations in how to make data accessible and available,\" he told TechCrunch.\n",
      "  On open source, he said the goal is to support ecosystem building by directing investment with the aim of ensuring that open source tools \"are as seamlessly usable as a proprietary tools\".\n",
      "  When it comes to AI accountability, the partnership hopes to \"unify the field\" -- working towards buy-in on standards for auditing AI systems that are accountable on merit of having the \"deep involvement by different populations and communities who are focused on the problems that we want [AI to help with]\".\n",
      "  \"For understandable reasons, there's a lot of focus around the huge [AI] investments. That's different,\" he also told us. \"Our focus here is around the public interest. Our focus is on smaller models. We're not optimizing for AGI [artificial general intelligence]... We're looking at smaller models where you need really high value specific data sets.\n",
      "  Story Continues\n",
      "  \"For example, on Parkinson's disease -- there's been an amazing standardization of data sets, put forward by the Michael J Fox Foundation -- like we're looking at really specific stuff to make a difference in people's lives.\"\n",
      "  Europe and the global south chip in\n",
      "  The initiative is being backed by a mix of public and private actors -- with governments including France, Germany, Chile, Kenya, Morocco and Nigeria among the nine countries listed as partners at launch (note: the U.S. is not a participant, neither are any governments across Asia so the AI effort is being drive by policymakers in Europe and the Global South. The other listed countries are Finland, Slovenia and Switzerland).\n",
      "  That said, also listed in the PR as \"core partners\" are (U.S.) tech giants Google and Salesforce.\n",
      "  On the private sector side, Tisné said the partnership is keen to work with industry research labs doing cutting edge work (such as in life sciences); with technology companies that have a distinct positioning vs the mainstream, such as as a result of how they and/or their customers are using open source, and with other large companies that are users and buyers of open source products; and with startups that are pushing the envelop on openness.\n",
      "  Other core partners for Current AI that have been named at launch are the French government (which is in the spotlight on AI governance this week as it's hosting the AI Action Summit in Paris); along with several philanthropic backers -- namely: The Ford Foundation; John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and AI Collaborative -- the latter being an Omidyar Group-backed AI governance policy lobby organization that sits within billionaire Pierre Omidyar and his wife Pam's network.\n",
      "  AI Collaborative's CEO, Tisné, is also the founder of Current AI. Discussing the gap Current AI's backers are seeking to fill, he argued there's a gap for a public-private funding vehicle that can build momentum behind efforts to drive AI development along public interest lines.\n",
      "  \"It's not a lack of public interest projects in AI, it's a massive fragmentation in the field and how we can just work on a much bigger scale,\" he told TechCrunch during a call, saying the initiative aims to drive \"public and private financing at scale of critical public interest AI projects\".\n",
      "  \"Some of which already exist,\" he continued, saying it's therefore \"a question of really bringing them together, but focusing -- focusing on effort so that we can help develop the next AlphaFold \", a reference to Google DeepMind's pioneering AI system for accurately predicting the structures of proteins inside the human body.\n",
      "  \"The private sector is rightly focused on private interests and works at a huge scale -- and is doing that with, you know, compute investments in the order of the tens of billions per quarter -- so we were trying to figure out what it is that we could do to really make a difference,\" Tisné also told us, noting: \"AlphaFold was developed on the base of a public data set, including, but not limited to the Protein Data Bank. So a big focus of ours is going to be on data from that perspective.\"\n",
      "  Public interest AI ecosystem support\n",
      "  Efforts to wide access to health data could for example focus on supporting development of privacy-preserving technologies to enable more patients to share their data for AI research, he suggested.\n",
      "  \"There isn't another partnership set up which is really designed to bring the whole field together and to bring together public financing at scale,\" he claimed.\n",
      "  Boiling the effort down further Tisné said Current AI's work will span three tracks: Firstly providing financial support to the sector in the form of direct financial contributions. It will also seek to play an incubating role -- aiming to, for example, support research work to nurture AI innovations. Thirdly, it will work on \"aligning funding so that different funders can work jointly based on shared goals and objectives.\" So here its backers hope to bring together diverse public interest AI support efforts and amplify impact.\n",
      "  The partnership will deploy around half its donated funds in the form of grant awards. The other half is being pegged for aligned funding efforts -- \"around openness, around data and accountability\", which Tisné said will include hitting \"really specific goals and objectives\" per program (that are as yet to be defined).\n",
      "  \"This isn't a this isn't a policy or a regulation play. It's really a building play,\" he added.\n",
      "  Current AI's PR includes a wider list of \"supporters\" and \"champions\" for the initiative -- citing an open letter of support from a span industry figures including the likes of Arthur Mensch, co-Founder & CEO of the French large language model (LLM) maker Mistral; serial entrepreneurs and investors Brent Hoberman and Reid Hoffman; Clement Delangue, CEO of AI firm Hugging Face; and Fidji Simo, an OpenAI board member and also CEO and chair of Instacart, among others.\n",
      "  In the letter they write: \"To achieve the best out of AI, society must be in charge.\"\n",
      "  \"In practice, this means ensuring that high-value datasets are accessible in privacy preserving and safe ways, incentivising the development of smaller, open AI models that cater to people's needs and are more environmentally friendly, and scaling up open-source AI to improve transparency, safety and accessibility for all,\" they go on, adding: \"The future of AI should belong to all of us.\"\n",
      "  Current AI expects to be unveiling fresh supporters and backers in the coming months, with Tisné saying they're particularly keen to work with the Gates Foundation given its focus on key verticals like healthcare.\n",
      "  If you're curious about their choice of name (Current AI), he said they were shooting for something that grounds in the here and now -- i.e. current-gen AI, not sci-fi stuff that might be coming down the pipe -- as well as wanting to play on ideas of electrical current and even diversity (think the current of a river and all the life than can teem inside it).\n",
      "  \"It's important to have more diversity in the AI field,\" he stressed, adding: \"We spent a lot of time in AI worrying about a really distant future and what might happen... So this is really an effort to focus on the opportunities and the harms today.\"\n",

      "Body: Generate Key Takeaways  South Africa's first black female nuclear scientist, Senamile Masango, a trailblazer who set out to inspire young women, has died aged 37, the government has confirmed.\n",
      " Ms Masango, dubbed \"the queen of science\" by some in South Africa, passed away on Sunday. The cause of her death is unknown.\n",
      "  Headstrong and ambitious, she \"was a beacon of hope for many young people, especially women\", a statement from Deputy President Paul Mashatile said.\n",
      "  Despite her success she said she faced discrimination as a black woman as she constantly had to prove that she knew what she was talking about.\n",
      "  Nevertheless, her unwavering determination earned her deep respect in her field.\n",
      "  Ms Masango was the first African woman to join an African-led team conducting experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory.\n",
      "  \"Masango's tireless efforts to promote science education and empowerment, particularly among women and disadvantaged communities, will be deeply missed,\" a statement from South Africa's Department of Science, Technology and Innovation said.\n",
      "  Born in 1987 in the rural village of Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, the historical seat of the Zulu monarchy, Ms Masango's mother was a princess in the royal family, and her father was a prominent figure.\n",
      "  She grew up in a polygamous family, with her mother being the youngest of three wives.\n",
      "  It was a challenging family set-up, she told local newspaper Sowetan Live, but she learned how to stand up for herself.\n",
      "  Her parents quickly recognised her early passion for learning and encouraged her to read extensively.\n",
      "  At 11, her geography teacher spoke about astronauts, sparking a lifelong interest in science.\n",
      "  \"I was so fascinated to learn that there are people who travel to space - leave this dimension - and go to the moon,\" she told Global Citizen, an organisation dedicated to ending extreme poverty\n",
      "  \"That's when I fell in love with science.\"\n",
      "  Ms Masango enrolled at the University of Zululand at 16 to study physics, but after becoming pregnant and failing some modules, she had to drop out.\n",
      "  With her family's support, she returned to complete her degree and later earned an MSc in nuclear physics at the University of the Western Cape, graduating with distinction.\n",
      "  Tragically, her daughter died in a car crash aged seven.\n",
      "  Beyond her academic accomplishments, Ms Masango established a foundation dedicated to encouraging young women to pursue science.\n",
      "  \"Girls are discouraged at an early age from taking science subjects; it is the root cause of the lack of women in the nuclear space,\" she said.\n",
      "  Her remarkable achievements included being named one of South Africa's most successful black women scientists under 35 in 2019 and earning a spot on the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans in Science and Technology list.\n",
      "  In 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community.\n",
      "  But throughout her career, Ms Masango faced misogynoir - the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender.\n",
      "  \"The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think!\"\n",
      "  \"There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,\" she said.\n",
      "  Yet, she persevered, using her journey to help inspire a new generation to pursue science fearlessly and boldly.\n",

Experts recommend continuous monitoring because the development of subsequent strategies and the increasing rivalry in the market of AI chips may affect the future financial fate of the industry and its lasting performance.

      "  SKX\n",
      "   Did you analyze how Skechers (SKX) fared in its international operations for the quarter ending December 2024? Given the widespread global presence of this shoe company, scrutinizing the trends in international revenues becomes imperative to assess its financial strength and future growth possibilities.\n",
      "  The global economy today is deeply interlinked, making a company's engagement with international markets a critical factor in determining its financial success and growth path. It has become essential for investors to comprehend how much a company relies on these foreign markets, as this understanding reveals the firm's potential for consistent earnings, its capacity to harness different economic cycles, and its overall growth prospects.\n",
      "  Participation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\n",
      "  While analyzing SKX's performance for the last quarter, we found some intriguing trends in revenues from its overseas segments that Wall Street analysts commonly model and monitor.\n",
      "  The company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $2.21 billion, showing rise of 12.8%. We will now explore the breakdown of SKX's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\n",
      "  A Dive into SKX's International Revenue Trends\n",
      "  Europe, Middle East & Africa accounted for 21.63% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $478.6 million. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of -2.42%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $490.49 million. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Europe, Middle East & Africa contributed $625.6 million (26.65%) and $383.5 million (19.56%) to the total revenue, respectively.\n",
      "  Of the total revenue, $642.4 million came from Asia Pacific during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 29.04%. This represented a surprise of -4.4% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $671.99 million to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $566 million, or 24.11%, and $622 million, or 31.72%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\n",
      "  Revenue Projections for Overseas Markets\n",
      "  Wall Street analysts expect Skechers to report $2.41 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. Europe, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific are expected to contribute 30.4% ($733.34 million) and 26.7% ($644.56 million) to the total revenue, respectively.\n",
      "  Story Continues\n",
      "  For the full year, the company is projected to achieve a total revenue of $9.78 billion, which signifies a rise of 9.1% from the last year. The share of this revenue from various regions is expected to be: Europe, Middle East & Africa at 26.1% ($2.55 billion) and Asia Pacific at 27% ($2.64 billion).\n",
      "  The Bottom Line\n",
      "  Skechers' leaning on foreign markets for its revenue stream presents a mix of chances and challenges. Therefore, a vigilant watch on its international revenue movements can greatly aid in projecting the company's future direction.\n",
      "  In an environment where global interconnections and geopolitical skirmishes are intensifying, Wall Street analysts keep a keen eye on these trends, particularly for firms with overseas operations, to adjust their earnings predictions. Moreover, a range of other aspects, including how a company fares in its home country, significantly affects these projections.\n",
      "  At Zacks, a company's changing earnings outlook is given considerable attention due to its proven, strong influence on a stock's price performance in the near term. The connection here is straightforward and positive: when earnings estimates are revised upward, the stock price generally follows suit, increasing as well.\n",
      "  Our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\n",

      "The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid space telescope has discovered an extremely rare Einstein ring. Einstein rings of light are produced when two galaxies are almost perfectly aligned, with one behind the other from a fixed perspective. They are one of the best examples we have of gravitational lensing–a phenomenon that Albert Einstein predicted in 1915. The ring and other findings are detailed in a study published February 10 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n",
      "\n",
      "A close-up view of the centre of the NGC 6505 galaxy, with the bright Einstein ring around its nucleus, captured by ESA’s Euclid space telescope. The Einstein ring is formed by gravitational lensing, with the mass of galaxy NGC 6505 bending and magnifying the light from a more distant galaxy into a ring.

      "Gravitational lensing and Einstein rings\n",
      "\n",
      "In space, gravitational lensing occurs when the energy in a massive celestial body like a galaxy cluster creates enough of a curve in spacetime for the path of light around it to appear bent as if by a lens. The celestial body that is causing the light to curve is called a gravitational lens, which should be able to help us detect the light from hidden galaxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, light will bend around objects in space, so that they focus the light the way that a lens does. This resulting gravitational lensing effect is larger for the bigger objects, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The lensing means that astronomers can sometimes see the light coming from far away galaxies that would otherwise be hidden. If they are aligned just right, the light from the distant source galaxy will bend to form a ring around the foreground object–called an Einstein ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we observe a distant galaxy with our telescope, its light may encounter another galaxy on its way to us. The foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying lens, bending the travelling light rays due to its gravity. This is called gravitational lensing. If the background galaxy, the lensing galaxy, and the telescope are perfectly aligned, the image appears as a ring–called an Einstein ring. Einstein rings were first theorized to exist by Einstein in his general theory of relativity. CREDIT: ESA.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An Einstein ring is an example of strong gravitational lensing,” Conor O’Riordan, a study co-author and astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, said in a statement. “All strong lenses are special, because they’re so rare, and they’re incredibly useful scientifically. This one is particularly special, because it’s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.”\n",

      "Studying the gravitational effects of Einstein rings can help scientists learn more about the expansion of the universe, detect the effects of invisible dark matter and dark energy, and probe background sources of light that are bent by dark matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Euclid’s new Einstein ring\n",
      "\n",
      "The Einstein ring that Euclid spotted is located in the galaxy NGC 6505. It is only a hop, skip, and a jump away from Earth at 590 million light-years away. This is the first time that the ring of light surrounding its center has been detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ring situated around the foreground galaxy is made up of light from a galaxy that is further out and more luminous. This background galaxy is about 4.42 billion light-years away and its light has been distorted by gravity as it travels. The far-away galaxy has not been observed before and does not have a name.\n",
      "\n",
      "[ Related: Dark energy fills the cosmos. But what is it? ]\n",

      "“I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,” Valeria Pettorino, a study co-author and ESA Euclid Project Scientist, said in a statement. “The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mapping the dark universe\n",
      "\n",
      "Euclid kicked-off its six-year mission on July 1, 2023. The space telescope’s primary job is to explore the dark universe, searching for the more subtle effects of weak gravitational lensing. Here, background galaxies appear to be only mildly stretched or displaced. In order to detect this effect, scientists will need to analyze billions of galaxies. Euclid began its detailed survey of the sky on February 14, 2024 and is gradually creating an extensive 3D map of the universe.\n",

However, the team says that finding a gravitational lens like this one so close to home is exciting. Less than 1,000 strong lenses were previously known to astronomers and even fewer have been imaged at high resolution.\n",

      "    Breakthrough agent technology transforms months-long AI deployment cycles into instantly configurable parameters, powered by proven NeuroSplit technology\n",
      "  SUNNYVALE, Calif., February 10, 2025 BUSINESS WIRE )--AI infrastructure innovator Skymel today announced the launch of its Orchestrator Agent, the industry's first real-time adaptive AI deployment solution that automatically optimizes model delivery strategies at the AI feature and inference level. This groundbreaking technology reduces traditional AI deployment cycles from months to seconds, enabling organizations to keep pace with rapidly evolving AI capabilities through simple configuration changes.\n",
      "  The Orchestrator Agent transforms how organizations deploy AI features, from simple API integrations to complex infrastructure decisions, making any deployment choice instantly configurable and adaptable. Powered by Skymel's established NeuroSplit technology, the Orchestrator Agent continuously monitors and adapts deployment strategies in real time while giving developers full control over decision parameters.\n",
      "  \"While the Agent handles the complexity of real-time optimization, developers maintain complete control,\" explained Sushant Tripathy, CTO of Skymel. \"Every decision parameter can be configured and adjusted instantly, ensuring your infrastructure adapts exactly how you want it to. This creates the first truly end-to-end adaptive orchestration solution for AI deployment.\"\n",
      "  Built as an intelligent agent that works alongside NeuroSplit's distributed compute capabilities, the Orchestrator Agent automatically optimizes:\n",
      "  Model selection and versioning strategies\n",
      "  Infrastructure configuration and scaling\n",
      "  Resource allocation across cloud and on-device\n",
      "  Performance and cost trade-offs\n",
      "  Compliance and security parameters\n",
      "  It continuously adjusts AI model deployment strategies to respond to changing operational conditions. The Orchestrator Agent operates at two distinct levels: Using speech-to-text as an example, at the feature level, developers specify capabilities like Whisper's transcription, translation, or language detection. At the inference level, NeuroSplit automatically handles all the complexity of execution. It can run small models directly on-device for privacy, split computation across device and cloud for optimal performance, or leverage larger cloud models for maximum accuracy – all based on configured priorities for cost, latency, accuracy, and privacy.\n",
      "  The Orchestrator Agent is designed to help organizations:\n",
      "  Eliminate months-long deployment cycles\n",
      "  Adapt instantly to new AI capabilities and requirements\n",
      "  Optimize resource usage automatically at the feature level\n",
      "  Maintain control while reducing infrastructure complexity\n",
      "  Future-proof AI infrastructure through configurability\n",
      "  Story Continues\n",
      "  \"In a world where AI agents are automating everything from coding to business processes, we're still making critical AI deployment decisions manually and months in advance,\" said Neetu Pathak, CEO of Skymel. \"It's paradoxical that as AI becomes more autonomous, its deployment remains rigid and static. The Orchestrator Agent changes this paradigm entirely. Instead of rigid, predetermined choices, we've created an autonomous agent that intelligently adapts deployment strategies in real-time, per-feature and per-inference. Just as AI agents are transforming how we work, the Orchestrator Agent is transforming how we deliver AI itself.\"\n",
      "  Skymel is now accepting applications for admission to the limited private beta program for the Orchestrator Agent, which is currently in use by a number of leading AI innovators. To apply, please visit www.skymel.com\n",

      "Title: Two new studies suggest Paris climate goal is dead. One scientist is going even further\n",
      "Body: CNN —  Swaths of the US may be grappling with frigid weather, but for the planet as a whole, heat records are being obliterated — and it spells very bad news.\n",
      "Two new studies conclude it's a signal the planet is likely on track to breach the Paris climate agreement goal of restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "  The studies, both published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, are the latest evidence the world is failing to tackle the climate crisis , and they come just weeks after an even starker warning from renowned climate scientist James Hansen, who said the planet was on course to shoot past 2 degrees of global warming over the next two decades.\n",
      "  While many scientists have said these levels of warming can be avoided with immediate, rapid emission cuts, the chances of this seem increasingly slim as international climate action falters . One of President Donald Trump's first actions was to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement and now others, including Argentina and Indonesia, are reportedly mulling withdrawal.\n",
      "  Ad Feedback\n",
      "  The Paris agreement is hugely symbolic. In 2015, almost every country in the world agreed to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees above the period before humans began burning large amounts of fossil fuels, with the ambition of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.\n",
      "  Above 1.5 degrees, scientists say increasingly extreme heat, drought, floods and fires will become hard for humans and ecosystems to adapt to. At 2 degrees, millions of more lives would be at risk and the danger rises significantly of triggering tipping points such as ice sheet melting and the death of the world's coral reefs.\n",
      "  Ad Feedback\n",
      "  Since 2015, 1.5 has become synonymous with staving off more catastrophic climate change. Yet global temperatures have kept rising. Last year was the first calendar year to breach 1.5 degrees.\n",
      "  As Paris goals refer to averages over around two decades, rather than single months or years, this means breaching the agreement can only be confidently confirmed in hindsight, once it's too late.\n",
      "  Ad Feedback\n",
      "  So scientists behind these two new papers attempted to determine whether the world is already in its first long-term period of 1.5 degree warming. The news is not good.\n",
      "  The study by Alex Cannon, a research scientist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, used climate modeling and found that 12 consecutive months of global warming above 1.5 degrees suggests a 60% to 80% chance the Paris threshold has already likely been crossed.\n",

      "  Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n",
      "  If the world experiences 18 consecutive months at or above the 1.5 degree limit, it will be “virtually certain” the Paris agreement has been breached, the report found.\n",
      "  The other paper, led by Emanuele Bevacqua, a climate scientist at the Helmholtz Centre in Germany, used real-world climate data and climate modeling. Looking at historical warming trends, it found the first single year to breach a temperature threshold also fell within the first 20-year period in which average temperatures reached the same threshold.\n",
      "  If these trends continue, it is almost certain 2024 will fall within the first 20-year period of 1.5-degree warming, the report concluded.\n",
      "  Both papers stress that rapid and strong climate action can still reduce the likelihood of breaching the Paris agreement goals over the next years and decades.\n",
      "  “To all intents and purposes, breaching the 1.5 degree threshold is a given,” said Richard Allen, a climate science professor at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the studies. “We need to double down efforts to avoid the even more dangerous 2-degree Celsius threshold by rapidly and massively cutting greenhouse gas emissions.”\n",
      "  For others, however, that ship has already sailed. The climate scientist James Hansen, who was among the first to publicly warn the world about climate change, said last year the 1.5 goal was “deader than a doornail.”\n",
      "  This month he co-authored a paper which concluded global warming is accelerating faster than expected, due in large part to regulations to reduce shipping pollution . While this pollution is a human health hazard, it also has the effect of reflecting sunlight away from the Earth.\n",
      "  As a result, he said, global heating is likely to exceed 2 degrees in the next few decades with devastating consequences, including ice sheet melt and sea level rise.\n",
      "  The new papers are undoubtedly bad news, said Daniela Schmidt, professor of Earth sciences at the University of Bristol, but she warned against fixating on 1.5 degrees. It “has the real risk of reducing actions, demotivating all of us,” if it's surpassed, she said.\n",
      "  A lack of ambition will keep the world on its current warming trajectory of around 3 degrees, she added. “Such warming has immense, and in parts irreversible, consequences for nature and people.”\n",

      "Body: Google Pixel 9a Launch:Soon the global markets will buzz with Google's next highly anticipated launch in the affordable segment, the Google Pixel 9a.\n",
      "We can expect that the smartphone will come with a number of new upgrades which would include a boost in performance, improved camera and a much more intuitive design. Through leaks only we know the launch date, expected specs and price of the anticipated device, though there is no official word from Google on these matters. When can we expect it? If we are to believe in leaks and speculations then the device will debut in global markets on March 19 and is expected to go on sale on March 26th. However, one thing to keep in mind is that the leaks that have suggested a specific timeline for its launch are only talking about sale dates in the US and the European markets. But we can expect the timeline to be the same as the US launch, as there is no official word on when the device will launch in India, a report said. What will be its Price? It is rumoured to be priced around $499 in the US which roughly corresponds to Rs 43,100, and the 256 GB variant is expected to go for $599 which is Rs 51,800 approximately. Its predecessor the Google Pixel 8a was launched in India at a price of Rs.52,999 and we can expect the same from Pixel 9a. ALSO READ:Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Early Leaks Reveal 200MP Camera And Sleek Design What can we expect features-wise The Google Pixel 9a is shaping up to be a pretty exciting release, and here's what we know so far. It's rumored to feature a 6.3-inch OLED display that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, meaning smoother scrolling and gaming. The display should also handle HDR10+ for better colors and brightness, with a peak brightness of around 2,700 nits. Plus, it's expected to be protected with Gorilla Glass 3, so it should hold up well against daily use. Powering the Pixel 9a, we'll likely see the Google Tensor G4 chip, which should give it the performance needed for everything from multitasking to AI features. It's said to come with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage—plenty of space for apps and photos. The battery is expected to be 5,100mAh, and it can support 23W wired charging and 7.5W wireless charging, so you can power up quickly. For connectivity, the Pixel 9a should have Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.3, and all the AI-driven features Google is known for. Plus, it'll have an IP68 rating, so it'll be resistant to dust and water, making it a solid choice for people who like to take their phone on outdoor adventures. When it comes to cameras, the Pixel 9a might have a 48MP main camera, which should be fantastic for detailed shots, along with a 13MP ultrawide camera for those bigger group photos or sweeping landscapes. Selfie lovers will also enjoy the 13MP front camera. It looks like the Pixel 9a is shaping up to be a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable, mid-range phone with great performance and camera features. We'll have to wait and see for the official confirmation, but it's definitely one to keep an eye on. ALSO READ:One UI 7 Update: Key Features You Can Expect On Galaxy S24 And S23\n",

      "Body: Generate Key Takeaways  The European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid space telescope has discovered an extremely rare Einstein ring.\n",
      "Einstein rings of light are produced when two galaxies are almost perfectly aligned, with one behind the other from a fixed perspective. They are one of the best examples we have of gravitational lensing –a phenomenon that Albert Einstein predicted in 1915 . The ring and other findings are detailed in a study published February 10 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics\n",
      "  Gravitational lensing and Einstein rings\n",
      "  In space, gravitational lensing occurs when the energy in a massive celestial body like a galaxy cluster creates enough of a curve in spacetime for the path of light around it to appear bent as if by a lens. The celestial body that is causing the light to curve is called a gravitational lens, which should be able to help us detect the light from hidden galaxies.\n",
      "  According to Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, light will bend around objects in space, so that they focus the light the way that a lens does. This resulting gravitational lensing effect is larger for the bigger objects , such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The lensing means that astronomers can sometimes see the light coming from far away galaxies that would otherwise be hidden. If they are aligned just right, the light from the distant source galaxy will bend to form a ring around the foreground object– called an Einstein ring\n",
      "  “An Einstein ring is an example of strong gravitational lensing,” Conor O'Riordan, a study co-author and astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, said in a statement . “All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically. This one is particularly special, because it's so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.”\n",
      "  Studying the gravitational effects of Einstein rings can help scientists learn more about the expansion of the universe, detect the effects of invisible dark matter and dark energy , and probe background sources of light that are bent by dark matter.\n",
      "  Euclid's new Einstein ring\n",
      "  The Einstein ring that Euclid spotted is located in the galaxy NGC 6505 . It is only a hop, skip, and a jump away from Earth at 590 million light-years away. This is the first time that the ring of light surrounding its center has been detected\n",
      "  The ring situated around the foreground galaxy is made up of light from a galaxy that is further out and more luminous. This background galaxy is about 4.42 billion light-years away and its light has been distorted by gravity as it travels. The far-away galaxy has not been observed before and does not have a name\n",
      "  “I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,” Valeria Pettorino, a study co-author and ESA Euclid Project Scientist, said in a statement . “The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.”\n",
      "  Mapping the dark universe\n",
      "  Euclid kicked-off its six-year mission on July 1, 2023 . The space telescope's primary job is to explore the dark universe , searching for the more subtle effects of weak gravitational lensing. Here, background galaxies appear to be only mildly stretched or displaced. In order to detect this effect, scientists will need to analyze billions of galaxies. Euclid began its detailed survey of the sky on February 14, 2024 and is gradually creating an extensive 3D map of the universe.\n",
      "  The space telescope is expected to map more than one third of the sky, observing billions of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years. Astronomers expect Euclid to spot 100,000 strong lenses . However, the team says that finding a gravitational lens like this one so close to home is exciting. Less than 1,000 strong lenses were previously known to astronomers and even fewer have been imaged at high resolution.\n",
      "  “Euclid is going to revolutionise the field, with all this data we've never had before,” said Conor.\n",

      "Body: Melody Schreiber  ·  6-min read  After Donald Trump signed executive orders ordering for mentions of race, gender, sexual\n",
      "orientation, disabilities and other terms to be scrubbed from US health agency websites, experts say the implications for health and scientific research are vast.\n",
      "  All pages at US health agencies were told to take down these mentions after Trump signed certain executive orders on his first day in office.\n",
      "  The orders were couched in terms of women's safety and DEI (or diversity, equity and inclusion) policies, but in fact they work to undermine broad swathes of the American public: trans and intersex people, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, women, disabled people and more.\n",
      "  Related: All the executive orders Trump has signed so far\n",
      "  The deletions needed to happen on Friday 31 January, employees learned. In response, thousands of webpages were taken down entirely. Some have come back online, but they have been scoured of the terms.\n",
      "  A note at the top of all webpages for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now reads: “CDC's website is being modified to comply with President Trump's Executive Orders.”\n",
      "  “This absence or erasure of really vital information is going to have a really harmful effect on many of these communities,” said Oni Blackstock, a primary care and HIV doctor and the founder and executive director of Health Justice.\n",
      "  “It's really devastating.”\n",
      "  Decades-worth of health data is vanishing overnight – and there are questions about whether data collection on these issues will continue.\n",
      "  Researchers receiving federal funding have been ordered to remove words such as “woman”, “disability”, and “LGBT” from their proposals and studies.\n",
      "  The US Food and Drug Administration removed its guidelines for recruiting diverse participants into research, which makes it more difficult to discern a medication's effects, both good and bad, on patients who are not white men.\n",
      "  The gag order even extends to internal communications. Employees at the CDC and the US Department of Health and Human Services have been told multiple times to remove their pronouns from email signatures.\n",
      "  “The public deserves to understand what's happening, whether it's bird flu or maternal mortality,” said Rachel Hardeman, a professor and director of the Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity at the University of Minnesota. “Not having that knowledge is a disservice to all of us.”\n",
      "  The Social Vulnerability Index , which tracks how disasters affect health down to the local level, is still offline. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which has tracked high school students' behaviors since 1990, has been reinstated, but key parts are still down. The website for the Office of Research on Women's Health at the US National Institutes of Health is a shade of what it once was . CDC pages that once referred to “pregnant people” now talk about “ pregnant women ” only.\n",
      "  Nearly all information about HIV for health providers and the public temporarily vanished in the purge.\n",
      "  “There was only one page that was up, a few days ago, that was about HIV. Every single [other] HIV page was down,” said Blackstock.\n",
      "  For the pages that have come back up, there are columns of information that have been removed, she said.\n",
      "  Target HIV , part of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, is still unavailable, for instance.\n",
      "  Guidelines for healthcare providers providing PrEP, the medication to prevent contracting HIV, are still gone, Blackstock said, adding: “Providers can't reference it so that we can take evidence-based, informed care of our patients.”\n",
      "  There were also many public materials taken down of pertinent information about, for instance, health disparities for trans people, she said, which creates “a vacuum of information” with direct effects on individuals' health behaviors.\n",
      "  Without this information, researchers and policymakers will struggle to make informed decisions around public health and healthcare, she said.\n",
      "  The CDC did publish annual data on maternal mortality on Wednesday. Black women are three times more likely than white women to die in childbirth – a rate that has not fallen over time, even as white, Hispanic, and Asian mortality has fallen slightly, the data shows.\n",
      "  Soon, the CDC is due to release data about these causes of death, but it is not clear if that publication will move forward given the new restrictions – or if the data will even be collected in the future.\n",
      "  “It's a lot of question marks at this point,” said Hardeman. “Even as an adviser to the director of the CDC, we've received zero information about what's coming … That's actually part of the concern. The silence is quite loud.”\n",
      "  The uncertainty is particularly alarming because experts expect mortality rates to increase after the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision reversed federal access to abortion. More people are now staying pregnant, which increases the chances of dying during pregnancy or childbirth.\n",
      "  “Understanding that landscape is incredibly important for how we proceed,” Hardeman said.\n",
      "  Related: ‘Really scary': rightwing watchlist found of mostly Black federal health workers\n",
      "  Hard data on maternal mortality has been “instrumental” for forming policies to prevent deaths, 80% of which are preventable, Hardeman said.\n",
      "  “How do we honor the lives lost if we're just going to move on and not even collect that data?” she asked.\n",
      "  Blackstock noted: “If you're removing information about the groups at highest risk, then that information is incomplete. It's actually potentially misinformation.”\n",
      "  Removing information could also diminish trust in science and scientific agencies.\n",
      "  “Is this still accurate? Is there data missing that's going to prevent us from drawing valid conclusions?” Blackstock asked.\n",
      "  These gaps will make existing disparities worse, the experts said.\n",
      "  “If people are not able to get information in order to be able to protect themselves, it's just going to make matters even worse,” Blackstock said.\n",
      "  Omissions in research and data mean that it could be harder to spot – and respond to – new patterns, which is a particular concern given outbreaks of bird flu, tuberculosis , measles, mpox and more.\n",
      "  “We don't really have a map or situational awareness of what is going on, and so that would potentially delay responses to any emerging health issues,” Blackstock said. “We then don't know how to allocate healthcare and public health resources in the way that we need to.”\n",
      "  The approach harks back to Trump's Covid response in 2020, when he said that cases would go away if no one was tested.\n",
      "  “It's the issue of ‘no data, no problem,'” Blackstock said.\n",
      "  “It almost allows the government to abdicate any responsibility, because they don't have to act on anything – because there's nothing to act on.”\n",

      "collaboratively, across a distance, in a \"breakthrough\" they say could lead to powerful quantum supercomputers.\n",
      "  The scientists linked two quantum processors that were six and a half feet apart using a \"photonic network interface,\" as detailed in a paper published last week in the journal Nature\n",
      "  The team, led by Oxford University Physics graduate student Dougal Main, hopes the achievement will lay the groundwork for a \"quantum internet\" of distributed ultra-secure processors.\n",
      "  It's not technically the first time scientists have demonstrated quantum teleportation. Previous research has shown that the states of quantum bits known as qubits — the equivalent of a conventional computer's bits, except they can be superimposed and entangled — can be transferred across physically separated systems.\n",
      "  ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "  \"In our study, we use quantum teleportation to create interactions between these distant systems,\" said Main in a statement . \"By carefully tailoring these interactions, we can perform logical quantum gates — the fundamental operations of quantum computing — between qubits housed in separate quantum computers.\"\n",
      "  \"This breakthrough enables us to effectively 'wire together' distinct quantum processors into a single, fully connected quantum computer,\" he explained, essentially the equivalent of linking traditional computers to create a supercomputer.\n",
      "  Main and his team are hopeful that by using light to transmit data instead of electrical signals, they can overcome engineering obstacles involved in creating large quantum computers. Broadly speaking, the more qubits a quantum computer has, the more difficult it is to keep them in a stable state and reduce external noise.\n",
      "  \"By interconnecting the modules using photonic links, the system gains valuable flexibility, allowing modules to be upgraded or swapped out without disrupting the entire architecture,\" Main explained.\n",

      "  But before quantum computers, let alone quantum supercomputers, can become a commonly used piece of equipment, researchers still have formidable hurdles to overcome.\n",
      "  \"Scaling up quantum computers remains a formidable technical challenge that will likely require new physics insights as well as intensive engineering effort over the coming years,\" Lucas explained.\n",
      "  Beyond the technical limitations of building bigger quantum computers, scientists are still struggling to turn them into actually useful tools that solve functional calculations.\n",

      "\n",
      "SEATTLE and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACHV), a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the global development and commercialization of cytisinicline for smoking cessation and nicotine dependence, today announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) has recently completed its second independent review of the ongoing ORCA-OL trial, evaluating long-term exposure of the novel 3 mg cytisinicline treatment dosing regimen in individuals who smoke cigarettes or vape nicotine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following this second comprehensive review of available safety data, the DSMC stated that it did not identify any unexpected treatment-related adverse events and that the participants’ adherence to their cytisinicline medication was excellent. Overall safety data remains consistent with previous findings. The DSMC concluded the study may continue as planned without any modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The positive outcome of the DSMC’s second review continues to confirm the previous findings from our Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials regarding the overall safety of cytisinicline,” said Cindy Jacobs, PhD, MD, President and Chief Medical Officer of Achieve. “This reinforces our confidence in the cytisinicline safety profile from the ORCA-OL trial and the broader ORCA program, moving us closer to filing our cytisinicline New Drug Application or NDA.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2024, Achieve announced the completion of the ORCA-OL trial enrollment, with 479 participants enrolled across 29 clinical trial sites in the United States. All participating sites and individuals were previously involved in Achieve’s ORCA “Ongoing Research of Cytisinicline for Addiction” program, which focused on smoking and e-cigarette cessation. In January 2025, Achieve announced that the ongoing ORCA-OL clinical trial had reached its goal of at least 300 participants completing six months of cumulative cytisinicline treatment, which was an important milestone for proceeding with the company’s planned NDA filing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rick Stewart, Chief Executive Officer of Achieve, added, “Achieve remains on track with our expected NDA submission next quarter for cytisinicline as a treatment of nicotine dependence for smoking cessation. We believe it will be the first new prescription treatment in nearly 20 years to provide physicians and smokers with an important new tool to stop smoking. Achieve remains focused on and committed to addressing the public health crisis of nicotine dependence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Story Continues\n",
      "\n",
      "The ORCA-OL clinical trial is designed to satisfy the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) long-term exposure safety data requirements for cytisinicline’s potential approval. The FDA requested six-month safety exposure data from at least 300 participants who have been treated with cytisinicline to be included in the company’s planned NDA, with one-year cumulative exposure safety data from a minimum of 100 participants treated with cytisinicline submitted during the NDA review period, prior to potential NDA approval. To date, Achieve has successfully completed two Phase 3 clinical trials of cytisinicline in more than 1,600 subjects who smoke cigarettes and have the desire to quit. The ORCA-OL clinical trial continues to evaluate longer-term safety exposure of the novel 3 mg cytisinicline three times a day dosing regimen in individuals who want to end their nicotine dependence.

      "Achieve Life Sciences is a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company committed to addressing the global smoking health and nicotine dependence epidemic through the development and commercialization of cytisinicline. The company has successfully completed two Phase 3 studies with cytisinicline for smoking cessation and one Phase 2 study with cytisinicline in vaping cessation. The company has fully enrolled its ongoing open-label safety study with cytisinicline and plans to submit its new drug application for smoking cessation in Q2 2025. Achieve has also conducted a successful end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for a future vaping indication. About Cytisinicline\n",
      "\n",
      "There are approximately 29 million adults who smoke combustible cigarettes.1 Tobacco use is currently the leading cause of preventable death that is responsible for more than eight million deaths worldwide and nearly half a million deaths in the United States annually.2,3 More than 87% of lung cancer deaths, 61% of all pulmonary disease deaths, and 32% of all deaths from coronary heart disease are attributable to smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.3 In addition, there are over 11 million adults in the United States who use e-cigarettes, also known as vaping.4 In 2024, approximately 1.6 million middle and high school students in the United States reported using e-cigarettes.5 There are no FDA-approved treatments indicated specifically as an aid to nicotine e-cigarette cessation. Cytisinicline has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to address this critical need. Cytisinicline is a plant-based alkaloid with a high binding affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It is believed to aid in treating nicotine addiction for smoking and e-cigarette cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing the severity of nicotine craving symptoms, and reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with nicotine products. Cytisinicline is an investigational product candidate being developed for the treatment of nicotine addiction and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any indication in the United States.

      "   We recently compiled a list of the 15 Software Infrastructure Stocks Outperforming In 2025 In this article, we are going to take a look at where BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB) stands against the other software infrastructure stocks.\n",
      "  Software stocks had a troubling end to the last year and some even continued to fall during January. After a solid year, profit-taking would have been acceptable. However, the continuous decline in January had investors worried, with some media personalities calling it the end of software stocks.\n",
      "  It didn't take the market long to change its views though. In general, software stocks are not as negatively impacted by tariffs as hardware stocks. Since Trump took over, people have been evaluating their options and with tariffs on the horizon, found software to be a relatively safe sector.\n",
      "  There were some concerns on the AI front as well. The emergence of DeepSeek AI has meant that companies in the US may not be willing to spend more on their AI ventures. Similarly, businesses could simply use DeepSeek's much cheaper technology, causing downward pressure on subscription prices for instance. So far, none of this looks like becoming a reality, so on the back of solid earnings, most software stocks have comfortably outperformed the market.\n",
      "  We decided to take a look at the top 15 stocks that are outperforming the market so far this year. To come up with our list of 15 software infrastructure stocks outperforming in 2025, we only considered stocks with a market cap of at least 2 billion that were outpacing the broader market till the end of last week.\n",
      "  Why BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) Went Down On Friday?\n",
      "  A research engineer surrounded by hardware, demonstrating the company's secure container offerings.\n",
      "  BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB)\n",
      "  BlackBerry Limited is an intelligent security services and software provider to governments and enterprises. It operates in IoT (internet of things), cybersecurity, and licensing & other segments. The company provides CylanceGUARD, CylanceINTELLIGENCE™, CylanceEDGE, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) Enterprise, BlackBerry SecuSUITE, CylanceENDPOINT, and other solutions. The company's stock is up 39% so far this year and its 1-year returns are closing in on 100%.\n",
      "  Blackberry's turnaround story has underwhelmed and were it not for its strange involvement in a meme-stock rally last year, its returns would have been muted. But the recent optimism points to the possibility of improving fundamentals and we look at why that's the case.\n",
      "  BlackBerry in December finally got rid of Cyclane, a division that was a drag on its business. It sold it at a fraction of the original acquisition cost but the company can now focus on other parts of the business. This news was well-received by investors as well and the stock has been on an uptick since.\n",
      "  Story Continues\n",
      "  The company's recent partnership with Microsoft also inspires confidence. As software-defined vehicles become the norm, Blackberry's technology becomes more and more relevant, though arguably the competition also rises. The company's QNX system which is already used in many vehicles could soon be available on Microsoft Azure after this partnership.\n",
      "  Overall BB ranks 2nd on our list of the software infrastructure stocks outperforming in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of BB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as BB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock\n",

      "   BP plc BP, the British oil and gas giant, has decided to hit the brakes on the production of renewable fuels at the site of its previous Kwinana oil refinery in Western Australia. The move is believed to be part of the company's cost-cutting initiatives.\n",
      "  BP had plans to construct a biofuels project in Australia, known as Kwinana Renewable Fuels (“KRF”), alongside a green hydrogen plant named H2Kwinana. The Kwinana refinery was once Australia's largest oil refinery, with a capacity of 146,000 barrels per day (bpd).\n",
      "  The KRF project was aimed at producing sustainable fuels from biomass. The cost of the project was estimated to be A$580 million. BP mentioned that even though it has decided to put a pause on this project, biofuels shall remain an important part of its strategy.\n",
      "  BP's decision is likely to have stemmed from increasing costs associated with the project. Furthermore, without a proper government mandate in place, BP faced uncertainties regarding the local demand for renewable fuels. This made the company unsure of whether the project would turn out to be financially viable. The company stated that it would scale back the project and adjust its pace of development while improving capital efficiency.\n",
      "  BP's KRF project was the first of five plants to convert biomass like cooking oil and vegetable fats into renewable fuels like sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. The facility was anticipated to have a production capacity of 10,000 bpd. In addition to renewable fuels, BP was also planning to start the production of green hydrogen at Kwinana. The public conceptual study for the green hydrogen facility estimated the cost of the first phase of the project to be A$399 million.\n",
      "  Many energy giants worldwide are cutting back on their investments in renewables amid rising costs to focus on their traditional oil and gas business to enhance profits. BP has recently pulled out of several renewable projects in an attempt to reduce costs and improve returns to shareholders. The KRF project was one of the three renewable fuel projects that were set to proceed even after BP cut back on its biofuels projects, including Lingen in Germany and Cherry Point in the United States.\n",

The data showcase the discovery of alpha-gal-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from red meat-allergic individuals, marking an advancement in the understanding of Alpha-gal Syndrome (AGS), also known as red meat allergy.\n",

      "\n",
      "Little is known about the properties of mAbs underlying AGS in humans due to the technical difficulty of isolating rare single B cells that produce alpha-gal-specific mAbs. Using its proprietary SEQ SIFTER™ platform, IgGenix discovered more than 60 mAbs from several red meat-allergic individuals. These antibodies exhibited a narrow binding affinity range despite diverse variable domain gene usage and antibody affinity maturation, suggesting molecular mechanisms that distinguish AGS from canonical food protein allergen hypersensitivity. Clonal families of similar antibodies exhibited persistence over time, suggesting mechanisms underpinning immunological memory in AGS.\n",

      "\n",
      "Companies today allocate significant resources to various aspects of software infrastructure, including servers and data centers for secure data storage and processing, cloud migration and management for scalable environments, network monitoring and management to ensure stability and security, and communication software. Additionally, software delivery and deployment solutions streamline application deployment, while bug tracking and error handling systems manage and resolve software issues. The increasing demand for cloud computing, digital transformation, and the integration of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning are expected to drive substantial growth in the global software infrastructure sector. As organizations continue to prioritize agility, scalability, and efficiency, the software infrastructure market is projected to expand rapidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a January 2025 report by The Business Research Company, the infrastructure software market size is projected to grow from $210 billion in 2024 to $220 billion in 2025, with a growth rate of 5.1%. The market has experienced strong growth in recent years due to spending on legacy system modernization, the increase in remote work, cybersecurity concerns, automation, and application performance optimization. The research firm anticipates continued strong growth, with the market expected to reach around $283 billion by 2029, at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Major players in the sector will continue to play a significant role by investing heavily in enhancing their offerings to capture market share. These companies are focusing on developing innovative solutions that leverage AI and automation to improve operational efficiency and enhance the user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey recently initiated coverage of 18 names in infrastructure and artificial intelligence software. In a research note to investors, he highlighted the growing importance of infrastructure software due to the ongoing secular expansion of AI and generative AI. These developments drive the demand for unified, secure, and highly integrated data systems, observable infrastructure, real-time computing and networking capabilities, and enhanced workflows and collaboration. Additionally, the analyst expects cloud infrastructure platforms to be pivotal in consolidating these functions.\n",

      "Our Methodology To identify the 10 best software infrastructure stocks, we conducted extensive research to compile a list of fundamentally strong U.S. listed software infrastructure companies with a market capitalization of $2 billion and above. We then ranked the stocks in ascending order of their potential upside, with the stock having highest upside ranked at the top. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 7. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) the Best Software Infrastructure Stock to Buy According to Analysts? A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Upside Potential: 22% Number of Hedge Funds: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a giant in the tech industry, offering a broad array of software, services, devices, and solutions designed to empower individuals and organizations to achieve productivity and computing prowess. Its cloud computing platform, Azure, is a major player in the cloud services market, providing scalable and flexible solutions for businesses of all sizes. Additionally, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers products such as Microsoft 365, Windows, LinkedIn, Dynamics business solutions, server products, and gaming. The company is currently focusing on integrating AI across its products to enhance data processing capabilities and operational efficiency, which should increase demand for its offerings. It has been aggressively expanding its cloud services, with Azure experiencing substantial growth driven by the rising demand for cloud computing and AI solutions. In its Q2 FY 2025 (FY ending June 2025) report on January 29, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a total revenue growth of 12% year-over-year (YoY), with cloud revenue growing 21% and achieving a gross margin of 70%. They are also planning to invest about $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on developing data centers in order to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications. Company CFO Amy Hood remains optimistic about AI-driven cloud services growth, stating: “Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services, healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier.” Overall, MSFT ranks 9th on our list of best software infrastructure stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

      "Body: It's unfortunate that our state auditor has jumped on the bandwagon of ill-informed interfering in the free market by trying to stamp out ethics and decency.\n",
      "In her Jan. 31 opinion piece in the Courier Journal, Allison Ball brags about browbeating financial institutions into shunning considerations that might help people. Claiming to be protecting the pensions of Kentuckians, she joins the chorus of those from the U.S. president to our state legislature who are more interested anti-woke breast-beating than producing results.\n",
      "  The gist of her opinion piece is that she is actively opposing private sector policies that place a value on a clean environment and expanded labor pools that might include immigrants and people with different abilities and backgrounds. She implies an unsupported criticism that socially responsible policies hurt investment performance. Baloney. Socially responsible investing has long-time and worldwide organizational support. There's no evidence it's risky. Some studies show a benefit. Maybe that's because the future is not in tough-sounding talk, but in sustainability and integrity.\n",
      "  Ball says that in addition to standing up for financial security, she's also helping protect Kentucky's energy industry. Coal has been very important to Kentucky, but smart investors wouldn't ignore the future. The solar energy industry has been growing at a rapid clip in the U.S. for years. Here in Kentucky there's a network of electric vehicle jobs including ones provided by two large battery plants under construction bringing more than 10,000, good-paying full-time jobs . Even the Kentucky Coal Museum has solar panels on its roof.\n",
      "  Oh, and all that socially responsible investing might even help ease the climate change-related floods and wildfires that jeopardize our children's standard of living. The environment is not a risky long-term investment strategy, it's a smart and sound one. The nation, Kentucky and our state auditor need to quit putting sloganeering over financial security.\n",

      "This image reveals how the star energizes the surrounding space and will illuminate a protoplanetary disk, a region full of gas and dust that might give rise to a new solar system. The formation is 450 light years away within the massive stellar nursery, Taurus Molecular Cloud.The latest findings on HH 30 were published on February 3 in The Astrophysical Journal. These observations contribute to the growing body of knowledge about star formation and the potential for new solar systems, offering astronomers an exciting new window into the universe's cosmic processes.James Webb Space Telescope captures image of a newborn star HH30 The James Webb Space Telescope recently took spectacular images of the HH 30 system, giving scientists a glimpse into star and planet formation. HH 30 is a bright nebula sited at 450 light-years away in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. It is created by high-speed jets of ionized gas that a young protostar emits. These jets into the surrounding gas and dust make waves as they crash into them, causing the material to illuminate. The system also features a dusty disk, seen edge-on, that may eventually form new planets. Webb's observations allow astronomers to study the complex interactions of these jets and their role in shaping stars and planetary systems.Much earlier images from Hubble only provided silhouettes of the dusty disk, but here with Webb comes detailed views that shall bring deeper insight into star and planet formation. HH 30 is one of the transient Herbig-Haro objects that evolve over thousands of years as their jets interact with the environment surrounding them. The results also contain information about the size and distribution of dust grains in the disk, which will help better understand what constitutes the building materials for planets and other cosmic bodies.The role of bipolar jets in the HH 30 system and planet formationThe HH 30 system is an excellent example of bipolar jets. Bipolar jets are streams of gas traveling at high velocities from the central protostar. The system contains a dusty disk, which is viewed edge-on. The disk covers the central star, and eventually, material could condense to form new planets. Interaction of the jets with the surroundings provides a dynamic, time-dependent system and provides a means for seeing the development processes involved during star and planet formation.Also Read | Austria's rare 'sun candle' phenomenon goes viral in Lanč's video, leaving social media users in awe: \"Nature is so magical\"Stay updated with the latest news on Times of India.

      " Software stocks had a troubling end to the last year and some even continued to fall during January. After a solid year, profit-taking would have been acceptable. However, the continuous decline in January had investors worried, with some media personalities calling it the end of software stocks.\n",
      "  It didn't take the market long to change its views though. In general, software stocks are not as negatively impacted by tariffs as hardware stocks. Since Trump took over, people have been evaluating their options and with tariffs on the horizon, found software to be a relatively safe sector.\n",
      "  There were some concerns on the AI front as well. The emergence of DeepSeek AI has meant that companies in the US may not be willing to spend more on their AI ventures. Similarly, businesses could simply use DeepSeek's much cheaper technology, causing downward pressure on subscription prices for instance. So far, none of this looks like becoming a reality, so on the back of solid earnings, most software stocks have comfortably outperformed the market.\n",
      "  We decided to take a look at the top 15 stocks that are outperforming the market so far this year.

Needham's $185 price target confirms the broader trend of bullishness but investors may need to keep one thing in mind. As strong as the company is, it has a rather fragile balance sheet. This means that if something goes wrong, it will have less room to maneuver. But for now, everyone is attaching a premium to the company's valuation despite these risks.\n",

      "Title: New Research from athenahealth Shows Patient Digital Engagement Tools Deliver Clear Benefits for Practices and Patients, but Adoption Remains Inconsistent\n",
      "Body: BOSTON, February 10, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--athenahealth, a leading provider of network-enabled software and services for medical groups and health systems nationwide, today announced findings from new research using deidentified data from more than 6,300 practices and over 50 million patients that shows healthcare practices with higher patient digital engagement experience improved financial performance and see a reduction in time spent on after-hours documentation. The findings also indicate that despite the clear benefits of digital patient engagement, inconsistencies remain in how practices and patients alike leverage these tools, with notable differences across specialties and patient demographics.\n",
      "\n",
      "This latest research comes from athenahealth’s proprietary Patient Digital Engagement Index (PDEI), an innovative tool to inform practices about their patient digital engagement. PDEI scores are calculated by looking at how practices are using online tools for activities such as patient scheduling, paying bills, and viewing test results. The research tracked and measured the digital engagement of practices on the athenaOne® network from 2021 to 2024. The network data was supplemented by a survey of 1,000 patients across the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher patient digital engagement correlates with improved financial performance and less after-hours work\n",
      "\n",
      "Findings suggest that investing in patient digital engagement can have a positive impact on practice performance and clinician satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The success of our practice depends on delivering superior healthcare to our patients,\" said Dr. Katherine Gregory, MD, MPH, San Francisco Gynecology and athenaOne customer. \"Our ability to achieve this requires that our patients have access to their health information and are provided with the digital tools to communicate with our office, self-schedule, and complete relevant administrative work online so they can maximize their time with their clinician. This is a win-win for clinicians and patients. When patients feel connected and involved in their healthcare, their overall experience improves significantly. Not only does it help patients feel informed and empowered, but it also saves our practice an incredible amount of time that we can then dedicate to patient care. Ultimately, investing in patient experience translates into better health outcomes and a more efficient practice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, the athenaOne network data reveals that higher rates of digital engagement correlate to improved financial performance for practices. Findings show:\n",
      "\n",
      "Story Continues\n",
      "\n",
      "Patient use of digital tools to pay bills, view statements and bills, and perform other financial tasks have had the highest rate of overall growth among patient digital engagement activities for practices between 2021-2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher PDEI scores correlate with higher patient pay yields for practices, meaning these practices collect a higher portion of the patient responsibility from their patients and therefore write off less. A one-point increase in PDEI was found to be associated with a one-point increase in the proportion of total patient charges paid within one year. \"As the healthcare industry continues to adapt to meet increasing patient expectations and demands, patient digital engagement tools have shifted from a nice to have, to a must have for clinicians and practices,\" said Paul Brient, chief product officer at athenahealth. \"The PDEI is a novel tool we provide to our customers so that they can actively measure and track their patients’ digital engagement to ensure they are delivering the experience their patients are seeking in today’s (and tomorrow’s) healthcare environment.\" Access to digital tools is important to patients Findings from the patient survey confirmed that access to digital tools is important to patients, especially for test results and scheduling. A majority (75%) indicated that it is somewhat or very important for them to use digital tools to connect with the healthcare system.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than three out of four patients agreed that digital tools simplify their interactions with the healthcare system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients are most interested in using digital tools to receive test results (73%), get appointment reminders (72%), and schedule appointments (67%). Network data reveals that patient digital activity varies across demographics Race, gender, and age significantly impact digital engagement: White and Asian patients across the network have the highest percent of their digital activity occurring online, while Black and Latino patients have the lowest. Millennials are the most engaged of any generation, with an average of 22% of all their healthcare activity occurring online in 2023. Women are significantly more engaged with healthcare digitally (20.5 %) than male counterparts (17.8%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Where a patient lives can impact usage of digital tools: Clinics in a rural zip code have significantly lower use of digital tools (PDEI 9.8) compared with those in suburban or urban areas (PDEI 13.6).\n",
      "\n",
      "The size and type of practice impact digital engagement: As the size of a practice increases, the median PDEI score also rises. Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) have shown the fastest improvement in patient digital engagement scores over time compared to other types of organizations. Among specialties, women’s health and behavioral health have the highest patient digital engagement scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some research findings warrant further investigation Initial findings revealed that clinicians working for practice with higher PDEI scores spend, on average, a lower proportion of their documentation time (aka \"pajama time\") after hours. This finding runs counter to a common perception that higher patient digital engagement – and rising patient expectations more generally – could lead to more after-hours work for providers. The finding warrants further investigation to determine what mechanisms could be contributing to the correlation between higher PDEI and decreases in \"pajama time\" for the physicians in these practices. Over the next few months, the athenahealth Product and Research teams plan to investigate potential mechanisms, such as the impact of appointment reminders and self-check-in and also explore potential cross correlations with other variables. To learn more about athenahealth’s Patient Digital Engagement Index research, review our key findings or download our comprehensive white paper, Patient Engagement in the Age of AI. Research Methodology The Patient Digital Engagement Index research included both quantitative and qualitative data from three different samples to ensure the most accurate data. The PDEI quantitative sample included clinical organizations that opted into research, were enrolled in athenaOne, were active between January 2021 and June 2024, and had valid PDEI measurements every month. The qualitative sample consisted of customer interviews to examine practice perspectives on patient digital engagement. This data was supplemented by a survey of 1,000 patients across the U.S., not restricted to athenahealth. Participant demographics were split evenly by gender, and had a varying distribution across race, age, and ethnic background.

Our innovative technology includes electronic health records, revenue cycle management, and patient engagement solutions that help healthcare providers, administrators, and practices eliminate friction for patients while getting paid efficiently. athenahealth partners with practices with purpose-built software backed by expertise to produce the insights needed to drive better clinical and financial outcomes.
