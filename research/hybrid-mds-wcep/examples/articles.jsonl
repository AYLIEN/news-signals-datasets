The 70-year-old once again denied any wrongdoing during a nationally televised address Wednesday. He said he would seek to invoke the law that would protect him from prosecution while he remains in office. \u201cIn order to continue to lead Israel to great achievements, I intended to approach the speaker of the Knesset in accordance with chapter 4C of the law, in order to fulfill my right, my duty and my mission to continue to serve you for the future of Israel,\u201d he said. NETANYAHU RUSHED TO BOMB SHELTER AFTER ROCKET ATTACK ON SOUTHERN ISRAEL The announcement came just four hours before a deadline for an application for immunity was set to expire, Reuters reported.

{"title": "Israel's Netanyahu seeks immunity from prosecution in corruption cases", "body": "(CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has requested immunity from prosecution in three corruption cases in which he faces indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu submitted the request to the Knesset late Wednesday night, saying he plans on leading the country \"for many years to come.\" \"What is being done to me is a field court-martial by misleading the public,\" Netanyahu said in a televised statement Wednesday evening in Jerusalem. \"The immunity law is intended to protect elected officials from fabricated legal proceedings -- from political indictment intended to damage the will of the people. This law intends to ensure that those elected can serve the people according to the will of the people, not the will of the law clerks.\" Charges against Netanyahu were unveiled in November. He's maintained his innocence throughout the ongoing criminal proceedings, calling them an \"attempted coup\" led by the left and the media. Rival Benny Gantz, who leads the Blue and White party, blasted Netanyahu's request, saying voters will have two choices in the upcoming elections in March. \" ... the interests of Netanyahu will win or the national interest will win. Or there will be an extreme immunity government or there will be broad unity government. Or the kingdom of Netanyahu or the State of Israel,\" said Gantz shortly after Netanyahu spoke. \"Blue and White led by me will do everything according to the law.\" Members of Knesset, including the Prime Minister, are entitled by law to request parliamentary immunity from prosecution. The request is considered by the Knesset's House Committee. If the request is approved in the committee, it is then passed on to a vote in the full 120-member Knesset. But the House Committee hasn't been formed since Israel's election in April began a period of prolonged political deadlock. Elections in September failed to break that deadlock, and once again, no House Committee was formed. Without a seated committee, there is no way to consider Netanyahu's request for immunity, putting any criminal proceedings against the Prime Minister on hold at least until the upcoming elections on March 2. Members of the opposition have said they would seek to form a temporary House Committee to consider the immunity request, but it's unclear at this stage if such a move is likely to happen. If granted, the immunity from prosecution applies only to the current Knesset, meaning Netanyahu would have to request immunity again following any subsequent election. Moments after Netanyahu finished his statement, former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said his Yisrael Beiteinu would vote unanimously against immunity. \"It's now clear beyond any doubt. All that Netanyahu is interested in is immunity,\" said Liberman in a statement. \"This is what he wakes up with in the morning, this is what he lives, this is what he breathes throughout the day, this is what he goes to bed with. The State of Israel has become a hostage of a private personal problem of Netanyahu.\" If the immunity request is"}
{"title": "Israeli court declines to rule on Netanyahu\u2019s eligibility", "body": "The court had been widely expected to delay any ruling. Judging Netanyahu ineligible would have triggered a major political crisis and exacerbated already strained ties between the government and the judiciary. Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Israeli Cabinet members are required to resign if indicted, but the rule does not apply to the prime minister. He has continued serving as caretaker prime minister after failing to form a government after unprecedented back-to-back elections last year. Netanyahu has dismissed the corruption cases against him as an \u201cattempted coup\u201d and warned against any judicial intervention, saying only the voters can choose the country\u2019s leader. There are no restrictions on Netanyahu running in the March 2 election \u2014 the third in less than a year. But the petition, filed by good government groups, contended that having a prime minister under indictment would constitute a conflict of interest. Others have argued that voters have the right to know before the election if Netanyahu is eligible to be prime minister. The court said that the election campaign period is \u201ca realm of uncertainty\u201d and that it remains to be seen who the president will select to form a government after the March 2 vote. The judges said that in light of the \u201cmost sensitive and complicated period the state of Israel is in at this time,\u201d it decided to \u201cact with restraint and moderation\u201d and dismiss the petition for the time being. The court\u2019s decision came the day after Netanyahu announced that he would seek immunity from prosecution, effectively delaying any trial until after a new government is formed. Netanyahu hopes to win big in March and assemble a 61-seat majority in favor of immunity. But polls predict another split decision that would prolong the country\u2019s political limbo. September\u2019s election left Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party in a virtual tie with the centrist Blue and White, led by former army chief of staff Benny Gantz. Neither was able to assemble a majority with its natural allies, and efforts to form a unity government collapsed in large part because of Netanyahu\u2019s legal woes. Netanyahu, who was re-elected leader of the ruling Likud party last week, has long accused judicial and law enforcement officials of trying to drive him from office. His allies have issued stern warnings against what they call an \u201cactivist\u201d court overstepping its authority and a few dozen pro-Netanyahu protesters convened outside the court in Jerusalem. Netanyahu has been in power for more than a decade and is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader. He is also Israel\u2019s first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime. His predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was forced to resign a decade ago ahead of a corruption indictment that later sent him to prison for 16 months. Associated Press writer Ilan Ben Zion contributed.

One thing you have to give him credit for, he ain\u2019t no quitter. My NEO piece below was a review of the situation after no political figure or party has been able to put a government coalition together to avoid a third election, something dreaded by all except Netanyahu. He is still interim prime minister, collecting a badly needed paycheck with his legal bills, and with next election round he has more time to wiggle out of his legal jam. The news this week was that the reformers who had filed a Supreme Court case to block him from running due to his indictment were turned down. The three judges ruled that there was no precedent to block him from running, and the only legal issue that could arise would be if he wins, and could he then take office while under indictment. As an inducement for Bibi to pull out of the last battle to form a government, giving him a pardon was floated from multiple directions, including the Attorney General and even President Rivlin. But Bibi just smiled and bided his time, remaining on the offensive with all of his detractors, refusing to give up the world wide pulpit his has to stay in the game. So like it or not, it is not just the Israelis who are stuck with him for at least the next six months, but the whole world. What did we do to deserve this I ask?

{"title": "Benjamin Netanyahu requests immunity from criminal prosecution", "body": "Jan. 1 (UPI) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Wednesday he has requested immunity from prosecution on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu said in a televised speech from Jerusalem's Orient Hotel Wednesday night that he had sent a letter of request to the Knesset, explaining that it is not an attempt to evade justice as immunity would only be in place during the term of the parliament that granted it. \"I will come to court and quash all the ridiculous libels against me,\" he said. \"The immunity law is intended to protect elected officials from manufactured cases, and guarantee that those elected by the people can serve the people according to their will and not the will of the legal officials.\" The three charges against him were unveiled in November, accusing him of having received gifts as the prime minister, paid for favorable news coverage and made regulatory moves to benefit news outlets in exchange for positive coverage. In the letter written by his lawyers to Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein, Netanyahu reiterated his innocence and requested immunity claiming the prosecution discriminatorily targeted him and that the court proceedings would harm the government. When the charges were first announced, Netanyahu dismissed them, describing the lengthy investigation that produced the three indictments as a \"witch hunt.\" The request comes as Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party, is campaigning to secure a fourth term at the country's helm. The country is to head to the polls March 2 after he twice failed in 2019 to cobble together a coalition government. Benny Gantz, leader of the Blue and White Party and Netanyahu's chief political rival, lambasted the immunity request in a televised speech of his own. \"I never imagined we would see the day when a prime minister of Israel would avoid standing before the law and the courts,\" Gantz said. The former military chief said the request shows that Netanyahu understands he is guilty and that the choice of granting immunity comes down to choosing between \"the kingdom of Netanyahu or the state of Israel.\" He said his party will amend the immunity law to prevent a prime minister from escaping criminal charges, calling such immunity corruption. \"We will not allow the legislature to become a haven for criminals,\" he said on Twitter. Avigdor Liberman, chairman of the Yisrael Beytenu Party, said they will vote down the immunity request, saying the country has been \"taken hostage by [Netanyahu's] personal and private problems.\" \"We are not going to be part of an immunity coalition,\" he said. \"We will vote against immunity.\" The Knesset House Committee, which has been defunct over the last year due to the consecutive elections, will next discuss whether to grant the immunity request."}

{"title": "Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to put himself above the law", "body": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is battling corruption and bribery charges while simultaneously campaigning for reelection in March 2020. On New Year\u2019s Day, he gave a speech that tried to tackle both topics at once \u2014 asking Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, to grant him temporary immunity from prosecution. \u201cImmunity is intended to protect elected representatives from trumped-up charges,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cI intend to keep leading Israel for many more years.\u201d The crimes of which Netanyahu is accused are serious, not \u201ctrumped up.\u201d And his request is vanishingly unlikely to succeed in the short term, as the idea does not appear to be able to win majority support in the Knesset. His appeal is best understood as a political gambit on two fronts. First, Netanyahu is bogging down the indictments in parliamentary procedure, preventing any politically damaging headlines regarding the case against him from being published until after the election. Secondly, he\u2019s trying to use the immunity bid to rally his hardcore supporters by making it clear that no immunity will be forthcoming without a victory at the polls. If Netanyahu and his allies win March\u2019s election, it\u2019s likely that immunity would be at the top of their agenda. The entire situation lays bare the stakes of the election with regard to the country\u2019s democracy. A Netanyahu victory would allow a man who is already Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister to both stay in office and grant himself immunity from allegations of serious criminal activity, including two separate schemes involving using the powers of his office to buy favorable media coverage. After Wednesday\u2019s speech, Netanyahu\u2019s chief political rival \u2014 the centrist Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz \u2014 claimed the election was a choice for Israeli voters: They could have either \u201cthe Kingdom of Netanyahu \u2026 or the State of Israel.\u201d He might very well be right. What the immunity request is \u2014 and why it matters so much The indictment against Netanyahu covers three different cases, with his alleged offenses including his receipt of inappropriate gifts from a billionaire and his corrupt arrangements with media magnates aimed at improving his press coverage. The technical charges are bribery, fraud, and breach of public trust \u2014 bribery being the most serious under Israeli law. Jail time is not out of the question: Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert got wrapped up in a bribery scandal during his time in office in the late 2000s and eventually served over a year in prison. Legally speaking, Netanyahu is well within his rights to request immunity from these charges while in office. Israel\u2019s Basic Law (its equivalent to a constitution) allows for any members of the Knesset to request immunity from prosecution; another piece of legislation, known as the Immunity Law, helps codify how that process works. The best technical explanation of all of this comes from Jonathan Lis, a reporter at Ha\u2019aretz, Israel\u2019s paper of record: He describes the four reasons for which a legislator can seek immunity: If the crime was committed as part"}
